singular circumstance that the
name of an outlawed individual of
the twelfth or thirteenth century
should continue traditionally popular,
be chanted in ballads, and, as one may say,</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv01">Familiar in our mouth as household words,</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">at the end of the eighteenth, excited the
editor’s curiosity to retrieve all the historical or poetical
remains concerning him that could be met with: an object which
he has occasionally pursued for many years; and of which pursuit
he now publishes the result. He cannot, indeed, pretend that his
researches, extensive as they must appear, have been attended
with all the success he could have wished; but, at the same time,
it ought to be acknowledged that many poetical pieces, of great
antiquity and some merit, are deservedly rescued from oblivion.</p>

<p>The materials collected for the “Life” of this
celebrated character, which are either
preserved at
large or carefully referred to in the “Notes and
Illustrations,” are not, it must be confessed, in every
instance, so important, so ancient, or, perhaps,
so authentic, as the subject seems to demand;
although the compiler may be permitted to say,
in humble second-hand imitation of the poet
Martial:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Some there are good, some middling, and some bad;</div>
<div class="dpv00">But yet they were the best that could be had.</div>
</div></div>

<div class="dkeeptgth"><p>Desirous to omit nothing that he could find upon
the subject, he has everywhere faithfully vouched
and exhibited his authorities, such as they are:
it would, therefore, seem altogether uncandid or
unjust to make him responsible for the want of
authenticity of such of them as may appear liable
to that imputation.</p>

<h2 class="h2herein">THE LIFE OF ROBIN HOOD.</h2>

<p class="pfirst"><span id="liferobindropcap"><img
src="images/i017b.png" width="167" height="168" alt="I" /></span>T
will scarcely be expected that one should
be able to offer an authentic narrative of
the life and transactions of this extraordinary
personage. The times in which he lived, the
mode of life he adopted, and the silence or loss of
contemporary writers, are circumstances sufficiently
favourable, indeed, to romance, but altogether inimical
to historical truth. The reader must, therefore,
be contented with such a detail, however scanty or
imperfect, as a zealous pursuit of the subject enables
one to give; and which, though it may fail to satisfy,
may possibly serve to amuse.</p>

<p>No assistance has been derived from the labours of his
professed biographers&#x2009;(<a href="#note01" title="go to note
1">1</a>);<a class="afnanc" href="#fn1" id="fnanc1">1</a> and
even the <span class="xxpn" id="p-ii">{ii}</span> industrious
Sir John Hawkins, from whom the public might have expected ample
gratification upon the subject, acknowledges that “the history
of this popular hero is but little known, and all the scattered
fragments concerning him, could they be brought together, would
fall far short of satisfying such an inquirer as none but real
and authenticated facts will content. We must,” he says, “take
his story as we find it.” He accordingly gives us nothing but two
or three trite and trivial extracts, with which every one at all
curious about the subject was as well acquainted as himself. It is
not, at the same time, pretended, that the present attempt promises
more than to bring together the scattered fragments to which the
learned historian alludes. This, however, has been done, according
to the best of the compiler’s information and abilities; and the
result is, with a due sense of the deficiency of both, submitted to
the reader’s candour.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p><span class="smcap">R<b>OBIN</b> H<b>OOD</b></span> was born at Locksley, in the county
of Nottingham&#x2009;(<a href="#note02" title="go to note 2">2</a>), in the reign of King Henry the
Second, and about the year of Christ 1160&#x2009;(<a href="#note03" title="go to note 3">3</a>).
His extraction was noble, and his true name
<span class="smcap">R<b>OBERT</b></span>
<span class="smcap">F<b>ITZOOTH</b>,</span> which vulgar pronunciation easily corrupted
into <span class="smcap">R<b>OBIN</b></span>
<span class="smcap">H<b>OOD</b></span>&#x2009;(<a href="#note04" title="go to note 4">4</a>). He is frequently
styled, and commonly reputed to have been,
<span class="smcap">E<b>ARL</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span> <span class="smcap">H<b>UNTINGDON</b>;</span>
a title to which, in the latter
part of his life, at least, he actually appears to have
had some sort of pretension&#x2009;(<a href="#note05" title="go to note 5">5</a>). In his
youth he <span class="xxpn" id="p-iii">{iii}</span>
is reported to have been of a wild and extravagant
disposition; insomuch that, his inheritance being consumed
or forfeited by his excesses, and his person
outlawed for debt, either from necessity or choice,
he sought an asylum in the woods and forests, with
which immense tracts, especially in the northern
parts of the kingdom, were at that time covered&#x2009;(<a href="#note06" title="go to note 6">6</a>).
Of these, he chiefly affected Barnsdale, in Yorkshire,
Sherwood, in Not­ting­ham­shire, and, according to
some, Plompton Park, in Cumberland&#x2009;(<a href="#note07" title="go to note 7">7</a>). Here
he either found, or was afterward joined by, a number
of persons in similar <span class="nowrap">circumstances—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Such as
 the fury of ungovern’d youth</div>
<div class="dpv00">Thrust from the company of awful men,”&#x2009;(<a href="#note08" title="go to note 8">8</a>)</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">who appear to have considered and obeyed him as
their chief or leader, and of whom his principal
favourites, or those in whose courage and fidelity
he most confided, where Little John (whose surname
is said to have been Nailor), William Scadlock
(Scathelock or Scarlet), George a Green, pinder (or
pound-keeper) of Wakefield, Much, a miller’s son,
and a certain monk or frier named Tuck&#x2009;(<a href="#note09" title="go to note 9">9</a>). He
is likewise said to have been accompanied in his retreat
by a female, of whom he was enamoured, and
whose real or adopted name was Marian&#x2009;(<a href="#note10" title="go to note 10">10</a>).</p>

<p>His company, in process of time, consisted of a
hundred archers; men, says Major, most skilful in
battle, whom four times that number of the boldest
fellows durst not attack&#x2009;(<a href="#note11" title="go to note 11">11</a>). His manner of recruiting
was somewhat singular; for, in the
words of an <span class="xxpn" id="p-iv">{iv}</span>
old writer, “whersoever he hard of any that were of
unusual strength and ‘hardines,’ he would desgyse
himselfe, and, rather then fayle, go lyke a begger to
become acquaynted with them; and, after he had
tryed them with fyghting, never give them over tyl
he had used means to drawe [them] to lyve after his
fashion”&#x2009;(<a href="#note12" title="go to note 12">12</a>): a practice of which numerous instances
are recorded in the more common and popular songs,
where, indeed, he seldom fails to receive a sound
beating. In shooting with the long bow, which they
chiefly practised, “they excelled all the men of the
land; though, as occasion required, they had also
other weapons”&#x2009;(<a href="#note13" title="go to note 13">13</a>).</p>

<p>In those forests, and with this company, he for
many years reigned like an independent sovereign;
at perpetual war, indeed, with the King of England,
and all his subjects, with an exception, however, of
the poor and needy, and such as were “desolate and
oppressed,” or stood in need of his protection. When
molested, by a superior force in one place, he retired
to another, still defying the power of what was called
law and government, and making his enemies pay
dearly, as well for their open attacks, as for their
clandestine treachery. It is not, at the same time,
to be concluded that he must, in this opposition, have
been guilty of manifest treason or rebellion; as he
most certainly can be justly charged with neither.
An outlaw, in those times, being deprived of protection,
owed no allegiance: “his hand was against
every man, and every man’s hand
against him”&#x2009;(<a href="#note14" title="go to note 14">14</a>). <span class="xxpn" id="p-v">{v}</span>
These forests, in short, were his territories; those
who accompanied and adhered to him his subjects:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“The world was not his friend, nor the world’s law:”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">and what better title King Richard could pretend to
the territory and people of England than Robin Hood
had to the dominion of Barnsdale or Sherwood is a
question humbly submitted to the consideration of the
political philosopher.</p>

<p>The deer with which the royal forests then abounded
(every Norman tyrant being, like Nimrod, “a mighty
hunter before the Lord”) would afford our hero and
his companions an ample supply of food throughout
the year; and of fuel, for dressing their vension, or
for the other purposes of life, they could evidently be
in no want. The rest of their necessaries would be
easily procured, partly by taking what they had occasion
for from the wealthy passenger who traversed or
approached their territories, and partly by commerce
with the neighbouring villages or great towns.</p>

<p>It may be readily imagined that such a life, during
great part of the year, at least, and while it continued
free from the alarms or apprehensions to which our
foresters, one would suppose, must have been too
frequently subject, might be sufficiently pleasant and
desirable, and even deserve the compliment which is
paid to it by Shakespeare in his comedy of <i>As you
like it</i> (act i. scene 1), where, on Oliver’s asking,
“Where will the old duke live?” Charles answers,
“They say he is already in the
forest of Arden, and <span class="xxpn" id="p-vi">{vi}</span>
a many merry men with him; and there they live
like the
<span class="smmaj">OLD</span>
<span class="smcap">R<b>OBIN</b></span>
<span class="smcap">H<b>OOD</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">E<b>NGLAND</b></span>;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden
world.” Their gallant chief, indeed, may be presumed
to have frequently exclaimed with the banished Valentine,
in another play of the same author:<a class="afnanc" href="#fn2" id="fnanc2">2</a></p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>How use doth breed a habit in a man!</div>
<div class="dpv00">This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,</div>
<div class="dpv00">I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And, to the nightingale’s complaining notes,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Tune my distresses and record my woes.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">He would doubtless, too, often find occasion to add:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>What hallooing and what stir is this to-day?</div>
<div class="dpv00">These are my mates, that make their wills their law,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Have some unhappy passenger in chace:</div>
<div class="dpv00">They love me well; yet I have much to do,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To keep them from uncivil outrages.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">But, on the other hand, it will be at once difficult and
painful to conceive,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">Their mode of life, in short, and domestic economy,

lived in the woods, had recourse to robbery for their
better support is neither to be concealed nor to be
denied. Testimonies to this purpose, indeed, would
be equally endless and unnecessary. Fordun, in
the fourteenth century, calls him “<i>ille famosissimus
siccarius</i>,” that most celebrated robber, and Major
terms him and Little John “<i>famatissimi latrones</i>.”
But it is to be remembered, according to the confession
of the latter historian, that, in these exertions
of power, he took away the goods of rich men only;
never killing any person, unless he was attacked or
resisted: that he would not suffer a woman to be
maltreated; nor ever took anything from the poor,
but charitably fed them with the wealth he drew
from the abbots. I disapprove, says he,
of the rapine <span class="xxpn" id="p-ix">{ix}</span>
of the man: but he was the most humane and the
prince of all robbers&#x2009;(<a href="#note18" title="go to note 18">18</a>). In allusion, no doubt,
to this irregular and predatory course of life, he has
had the honour to be compared to the illustrious
Wallace, the champion and deliverer of his country;
and that, it is not a little remarkable, in the latter’s
own time&#x2009;(<a href="#note19" title="go to note 19">19</a>).</p>

<p>Our hero, indeed, seems to have held bishops,
abbots, priests, and monks, in a word, all the clergy,
regular or secular, in decided aversion.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>These
 byshoppes and thyse archebyshoppes,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Ye shall them bete and bynde,”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">was an injunction carefully impressed upon
his followers. The Abbot of Saint Mary’s, in York&#x2009;(<a
href="#note20" title="go to note 20">20</a>), from some unknown
cause, appears to have been distinguished by particular animosity;
and the Sheriff of Not­ting­ham­shire&#x2009;(<a href="#note21"
title="go to note 21">21</a>), who may have been too active and
officious in his endeavours to apprehend him, was the unremitted
object of his vengeance.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, however, the aversion in which
he appears to have held the clergy of every denomination,
he was a man of exemplary piety, according
to the notions of that age, and retained a domestic
chaplain (Frier Tuck, no doubt) for the diurnal celebration
of the divine mysteries. This we learn from
an anecdote preserved by Fordun&#x2009;(<a href="#note22" title="go to note 22">22</a>), as an instance
of those actions which the historian allows to deserve
commendation. One day, as he heard mass, which
he was most devoutly accustomed to do
(nor would <span class="xxpn" id="p-x">{x}</span>
he, in whatever necessity, suffer the office to be interrupted,)
he was espied by a certain sheriff and
officers belonging to the king, who had frequently
before molested him in that most secret recess of
the wood where he was at mass. Some of his people,
who perceived what was going forward, advised him
to fly with all speed, which, out of reverence to the
sacrament, which he was then most devoutly worshipping,
he absolutely refused to do. But the rest
of his men having fled for fear of death, Robin, confiding
solely in Him whom he reverently worshipped,
with a very few, who by chance were present, set
upon his enemies, whom he easily vanquished; and,
being enriched with their spoils and ransom, he
always held the ministers of the Church and masses
in greater veneration ever after, mindful of what is
vulgarly said:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Him God does surely hear</div>
<div class="dpv00">Who oft to th’ mass gives ear.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>Having, for a long series of years, maintained a
sort of independent sovereignty, and set kings, judges,
and magistrates at defiance, a proclamation was
published&#x2009;(<a href="#note23" title="go to note 23">23</a>) offering a considerable reward for
bringing him in either dead or alive; which, however,
seems to have been productive of no greater
success than former attempts for that purpose. At
length, the infirmities of old age increasing upon
him&#x2009;(<a href="#note24" title="go to note 24">24</a>), and desirous to be relieved, in a fit of sickness,
by being let blood, he applied for that purpose
to the Prioress of Kirkleys nunnery
in Yorkshire, his <span class="xxpn" id="p-xi">{xi}</span>
relation (women, and particularly religious women,
being, in those times, somewhat better skilled in
surgery than the sex is at present), by whom he was
treacherously suffered to bleed to death. This event
happened on the 18th of November 1247, being the
31st year of King Henry III. and (if the date assigned
to his birth be correct) about the 87th of his age&#x2009;(<a href="#note24" title="go to note 24">24</a>).
He was interred under some trees, at a short distance
from the house; a stone being placed over his grave,
with an inscription to his memory&#x2009;(<a href="#note25" title="go to note 25">25</a>).</p>

<p>Such was the end of Robin Hood: a man who, in
a barbarous age, and under a complicated tyranny,
displayed a spirit of freedom and independence
which has endeared him to the common people,
whose cause he maintained (for all opposition to
tyranny is the cause of the people), and, in spite of
the malicious endeavours of pitiful monks, by whom
history was consecrated to the crimes and follies of
titled ruffians and sainted idiots, to suppress all
record of his patriotic exertions and virtuous acts,
will render his name immortal.</p>

<p>With respect to his personal character: it is sufficiently
evident that he was active, brave, prudent,
patient; possessed of uncommon bodily strength and
considerable military skill; just, generous, benevolent,
faithful, and beloved or revered by his followers
or adherents for his excellent and amiable qualities.
Fordun, a priest, extols his piety, Major (as we have
seen) pronounces him the most humane and the prince
of all robbers; and Camden, whose
testimony is of
<span class="xxpn" id="p-xii">{xii}</span>
some weight, calls him “<i>prædonem mitissimum</i>,” the
gentlest of thieves. As proofs of his universal and
singular popularity: his story and exploits have
been made the subject as well of various dramatic
exhibitions&#x2009;(<a href="#note26" title="go to note 26">26</a>), as of innumerable poems, rimes,
songs and ballads&#x2009;(<a href="#note27" title="go to note 27">27</a>): he has given rise to divers
proverbs&#x2009;(<a href="#note28" title="go to note 28">28</a>); and to swear by him, or some of his
companions, appears to have been a usual practice&#x2009;(<a href="#note29" title="go to note 29">29</a>):
his songs have been chanted on the most solemn
occasions&#x2009;(<a href="#note30" title="go to note 30">30</a>); his service sometimes preferred to
the Word of God&#x2009;(<a href="#note31" title="go to note 31">31</a>): he may be regarded as the
patron of archery&#x2009;(<a href="#note32" title="go to note 32">32</a>); and, though not actually
canonised (a situation to which the miracles wrought
in his favour, as well in his lifetime as after his
death, and the supernatural powers he is, in some
parts, supposed to have possessed&#x2009;(<a href="#note33" title="go to note 33">33</a>), give him an
indisputable claim), he obtained the principal distinction
of sainthood, in having a festival allotted to
him, and solemn games instituted in honour of his
memory, which were celebrated till the latter end
of the sixteenth century; not by the populace only,
but by kings or princes and grave magistrates; and
that as well in Scotland as in England; being considered,
in the former country, of the highest political
importance, and essential to the civil and religious
liberties of the people, the efforts of government
to suppress them frequently producing tumult
and insurrection&#x2009;(<a href="#note34" title="go to note 34">34</a>). His bow, and one of his
arrows, his chair, his cap, and one of his slippers,
were preserved, with peculiar
veneration, till within <span class="xxpn" id="p-xiii">{xiii}</span>
the present century&#x2009;(<a href="#note35" title="go to note 35">35</a>); and not only places which
afforded him security or amusement, but even the
well at which he quenched his thirst, still retain his
name&#x2009;(<a href="#note36" title="go to note 36">36</a>): a name which, in the middle of the
present century, was conferred as a singular distinction
upon the prime minister to the king of Madagascar&#x2009;(<a href="#note37" title="go to note 37">37</a>).</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>After his death his company was dispersed&#x2009;(<a href="#note38" title="go to note 38">38</a>).
History is silent in particulars: all that we can, therefore,
learn is, that the honour of Little John’s death
and burial is contended for by rival nations&#x2009;(<a href="#note39" title="go to note 39">39</a>);
that his grave continued long “celebrous for the
yielding of excellent whetstones;” and that some of

himself bore, and they from him, were in being so

<h2 class="h2herein">NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS REFERRED
TO IN THE FOREGOING LIFE.</h2>

<p id="note01">(1)
<i>“Former biographers,” &amp;c.</i>]
Such, that is, as have
already appeared in print, since a sort of manuscript life in
the Sloane Library will appear to have been of some service.
The first of these respectable personages is the author, or
rather compiler, of “The noble birth and gallant achievements
of that remarkable outlaw Robin Hood; together
with a true account of the many merry extravagant exploits
he played; in twelve several stories: newly collected by an
ingenious antiquary. London, printed by W. O.” [William
Onley], 4to, black letter, no date. These “several stories,”
in fact, are only so many of the songs in the common
Garland transposed; and the “ingenious antiquary,” who
strung them together, has known so little of his trade, that
he sets out with informing us of his hero’s banishment by
King Henry the Eighth. The above is supposed to be the
“small merry book” called Robin Hood, mentioned in a
list of “books, ballads, and histories, printed for and sold
by William Thackeray at the Angel in Duck-lane” (about
1680), preserved in one of the volumes of old ballads (part
of Bagford’s collection) in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Another piece of biography, from which much will not be
expected, is “The lives and heroick atchievements of the
renowned Robin Hood and James Hind, two noted robbers
and highwaymen. London, 1752.” 8vo. This, however,
is probably nothing more than an extract from Johnson’s
“Lives of the Highwaymen,” in which, as a specimen of the
authors historical authenticity, we have the life and actions
of that noted robber, Sir John Falstaff.</p>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p-xv">{xv}</span></div>

<p>The principal if not sole reason why our hero is never
once mentioned by Matthew Paris, Benedictus Abbas, or
any other ancient English historian, was most probably his
avowed enmity to churchmen; and history, in former times,
was written by none but monks. They were unwilling to
praise the actions which they durst neither misrepresent nor
deny. Fordun and Major, however, being foreigners, have
not been deterred by this professional spirit from rendering
homage to his virtues.</p>

<p id="note02">(2)&#x2005;—“<i>was
born at Locksley, in the county of Nottingham.</i>”]
“Robin Hood,” says a MS. in the British Museum
(Bib. Sloan. 715), written, as it seems, toward the end of
the sixteenth century, “was borne at Lockesley in Yorkshyre,
or after others in Not­ting­ham­shire.” The writer here labours
under manifest ignorance and confusion, but the first row
of the rubric will set him right:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>In
 Locksly town, in merry Not­ting­ham­shire,</div>
<div class="dpv01">In merry sweet Locksly town,</div>
<div class="dpv00">There bold Robin Hood was born and was bred,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Bold Robin of famous renown.”&#x202f;<a
 class="afnanc" href="#fn4" id="fnanc4">4</a></div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">Dr. Fuller (Worthies of England, 1662, p. 320) is doubtful
as to the place of his nativity. Speaking of the “Memorable
Persons” of Not­ting­ham­shire, “Robert Hood,” says he,
“(if not by birth) by his chief abode this country-man.”</p>

<p>The name of such a town as Locksley, or Loxley (for so we
sometimes find it spelled), in the county of Nottingham or of
York, does not, it must be confessed, occur either in Sir Henry
Spelman’s Villare Anglicum. in Adams’s Index Villaris, in Whatley’s
England’s Gazetteer,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn5" id="fnanc5">5</a>
in Thoroton’s History of Not­ting­ham­shire, or in the Nomina Villarum
Eboracensium (York, 1768, 8vo). The silence of these authorities
is not, however, to be regarded as a conclusive proof that such
a place never existed. The names of towns and villages, of which
no trace is now to be found but in ancient writings, would fill a
volume.</p>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p-xvi">{xvi}</span></div>

<p id="note03">(3)&#x2005;—“<i>in
the reign of King Henry the Second, and about
the year of Christ 1160.</i>”] “Robin Hood,” according to the Sloane
MS., “was borne .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the dayes of Henry the 2nd,
about the yeare 1160.” This was the 6th year of that monarch; at
whose death (anno 1189) he would, of course, be about 29 years of
age. Those writers are therefore pretty correct who represent him
as playing his pranks (Dr. Fuller’s phrase) in the reign of King
Richard the First, and, according to the last-named author, “about
the year of our Lord 1200.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn6"
id="fnanc6">6</a> Thus Mair (who is followed by Stowe, Annales,
1592, p. 227), “Circa hæc tempora [sci. Ricardi I.] ut auguror,”
&amp;c. A MS. note in the Museum (Bib. Har. 1233), not, in Mr.
Wanley’s opinion, to be relied on, places him in the same period,
“Temp. Rich. I.” Nor is Fordun altogether out of his reckoning in
bringing him down to the time of Henry III., as we shall hereafter
see; and with him agrees Andrew of Wyntowne, in his “Oryginale
Cronykil,” written about 1420, which, at the year 1283, has the
following lines:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Lytil
 Jhon and Robyne Hude</div>

<div class="dpv00">In Yngil-wode and Barnysdale</div>
<div class="dpv00">Thai oysyd all this tyme thare trawale.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">A modern writer (History of Whitby, by Lionel Charlton,
York, 1779, 4to), though of no authority in this point,
has done well enough to speak of him as living “in the
days of abbot Richard and Peter his successor;” that is,
between the years 1176 and 1211. The author of the two
plays upon the story of our hero, of which a particular account
will be hereafter given, makes him contemporary with
King Richard, who, as well as his brother Prince John, is
introduced upon the scene; which is confirmed by another
play, quoted in Note
<a href="#note05" title="go to note 5">5</a>. Warner, also, in his Albion’s
England, 1602, p. 132, refers his existence to “better daies,
first Richard’s daies.” This, to be sure, may not be such
evidence as would be sufficient to decide the point in a
court of justice; but neither judge nor
counsel will dispute <span class="xxpn" id="p-xvii">{xvii}</span>
the authority of that oracle of the law Sir Edward Coke,
who pronounces that “This Robert Hood lived in the reign
of King R. I.” (3 Institute, 197).</p>

<p>We must not therefore regard what is said by such writers
as the author of “George a Greene, the pinner of Wakefield,”
1599 (see Note <a href="#note09" title="go to note 9">9</a>), who represents our hero as contemporary
with King Edward IV.,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn7" id="fnanc7">7</a> and the compiler of a
foolish book called “The noble birth, &amp;c. of Robin Hood”
(see Note <a href="#note01" title="go to note 1">1</a>), who commences it by informing us of his
banishment by King Henry VIII. As well, indeed, might
we suppose him to have lived before the time of Charlemagne,
because Sir John Harington, in his translation of the
Orlando Furioso, 1590, p. 391, has made</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Duke
 ’Ammon in great wrath thus wise to speake:</div>
<div class="dpv00">This is a Tale indeed of Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Which to beleeve, might show my wits but weake;”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">or to imagine his story must have been familiar to Plutarch,
because in his Morals, translated by Dr. Philemon Holland,
1603, p. 644, we read the following passage:—“Evenso
[<i>i.e.</i> as the crane and fox serve each other in Æsop], when
learned men at a table plunge and drowne themselves (as it
were), in subtile problemes and questions interlaced with
logicke, which the vulgar sort are not able for their lives to
comprehend and conceive; whiles they also againe for their
part come in with their foolish songs, and vain ballads of
Robin-Hood and Little John, telling tales of a tubbe, or of
a roasted horse, and such like.” Who, indeed, would be
apt to think that his skill in archery was known to Virgil?
And yet, as interpreted by our facetious friend Mr. Charles
Cotton, he tells us that</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Cupid
 was a little tyny,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Cogging, lying, peevish nynny;</div>
<div class="dpv00">But with a bow the shit-breecht elf</div>
<div class="dpv00">Would shoot like Robin Hood himself.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">In a word, if we are to credit translators,
he must have <span class="xxpn" id="p-xviii">{xviii}</span>
existed before the siege of Troy; for thus, according to one
of Homer’s:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Then

<div class="dpv00">Of Robin Hood and Little John,</div>

<div class="dpoemcite"><i>Iliad</i>, by Bridges, 4to, p. 231.<a
 class="afnanc" href="#fn8" id="fnanc8">8</a></div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">This last supposition, indeed, has even the
respectable countenance of Dan Geoffrey Chaucer:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Pandarus

<p id="note04">(4)
“<i>His extraction was noble, and his true name Robert
Fitzooth.</i>”] In “an olde and auncient pamphlet,” which
Grafton the chronicler had seen, it was written that “This
man discended of a noble parentage.” The Sloane MS.
says “He was of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. parentage;” and though the material
word is illegible, the sense evidently requires noble. So,
likewise, the Harleian note: “It is said that he was of noble
blood.” Leland also has expressly termed him “nobilis”
(Collectanea, i. 54). The following account of his family
will be found sufficiently particular. Ralph Fitzothes, or
Fitzooth, a Norman, who had come over to England with
William Rufus, married Maud or Matilda, daughter of
Gilbert de Gaunt, Earl of Kyme and Lindsey, by whom he
had two sons: Philip, afterward Earl of Kyme, that earldom
being part of his mother’s dowry, and William. Philip the
elder died without issue; William was a ward to Robert
de Vere, Earl of Oxford, in whose household he received his
education, and who, by the king’s
express command, gave <span class="xxpn" id="p-xix">{xix}</span>
him in marriage to his own niece, the youngest of the three
daughters of the celebrated Lady Roisia de Vere, daughter
of Aubrey de Vere, Earl of Guisnes in Normandy, and lord
high chamberlain of England under Henry I., and of Adeliza,
daughter to Richard de Clare, Earl of Clarence and Hertford,
by Payn de Beauchamp, baron of Bedford, her second husband.
The offspring of this marriage was our hero, Robert
Fitzooth, commonly called Robin Hood. (See Stukeley’s
Palæographia Britannica, No. I. passim.)</p>

<p>A writer in the Gentleman’s Magazine for March 1793, under the
signature D. H.,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn9" id="fnanc9">9</a>
pretends that Hood is only a corruption of “o’ th’ wood, q.d. of
Sherwood.” This, to be sure, is an absurd conceit; but, if the name
were a matter of conjecture, it might be probably enough referred
to some particular sort of hood our hero wore by way of distinction
or disguise. See Scot’s Discoverie of Witchcraft, 1584, p. 522. In
Jonson’s masque of “The king’s entertainment at Welbeck” (Works,
1756, vii. 53), certain characters are introduced “in livery
hoods,” of whom Fitz-ale says,</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Six
 hoods they are, and of the blood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">They tell of ancient Robin Hood.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">It may be remembered that Hugh <i>Capet</i>, the
first king of France of the third and last race, obtained that
surname from a similar circumstance. It is unnecessary to add
that Hood is a common surname at this day, as well as a place in
Yorkshire, formerly <i>Hode</i>; and that Edward the Third, in the
tenth year of his reign, confirmed to Thomas, the son of <i>Robert
de Hode</i>, of Hoveden, in tail-general, certain places of moorland,
<i>&amp;c.</i> <i>in vasto de</i> Incklesmore, <i>&amp;c.</i> (Ro. Pa. 10 E. 3. m.
31).</p>

<p id="note05">(5)
“<i>He is frequently styled .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Earl of Huntingdon, a
title to which, for the latter part of his life at least, he actually
appears to have had some sort of pretension.</i>”] In Grafton’s
“olde and auncient pamphlet,” though the author had, as
already noticed, said “this man discended of a <span class="smmaj">NOBLE
PARENTAGE</span>,” he adds, “or rather beyng of
a base stocke <span class="xxpn" id="p-xx">{xx}</span>
and linage, was for his manhood and chivalry advaunced to the
noble dignitie of an <span class="smmaj">ERLE</span>.”</p>

<p>In the MS. note (Bib. Har. 1233) is the following passage:
“It is said that he was of noble blood no lesse then an earle.”
Warner, in his Albion’s England, already cited, calls him “a
county.” The titles of Mundy’s two plays are: “The downfall”
and “The death of Robert earle of Hun­ting­ton.” He
is likewise introduced in that character in the same author’s
Metropolis Coronata, hereafter cited. In his epitaph we shall
find him expressly styled “Robert, Earl of Huntingtun.”</p>

<p>In “A pleasant commodie called Looke about you,”
printed in 1600, our hero is introduced, and performs a principal
part. He is represented as the young Earl of Hun­ting­ton,
and in ward to Prince Richard, though his brother
Henry, the young king, complains of his having “had wrong
about his wardship.” He is described as</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>A
 gallant youth, a proper gentleman;”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">and is sometimes called “pretty earle” and “little wag.”
One of the characters thus addresses him:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>But
 welcome, welcome, and young Hun­ting­ton,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Sweet Robyn Hude, honor’s best flowing bloome,”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">and calls him</p>

<p class="pcontinue">It is also said that</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>His

<p>Dr. Percy’s objection, that the most ancient poems make
no mention of this earldom,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn10"

in another place. How he founded his pretensions to this title

<i>“In his youth he is reported to have been of a wild and
extravagant disposition,” &amp;c.</i>] Grafton’s pamphlet, after
supposing him to have been “advaunced to the noble dignitie of
an erle,” continued thus: “But afterwardes he so prodigally
exceeded in charges and expences, that he fell into great debt,
by reason whereof, so many actions and sutes were commenced
against him whereunto he answered not, that by <span class="xxpn"
id="p-xxiii">{xxiii}</span> order of lawe he was outlawed.”&#x202f;<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn12" id="fnanc12">12</a> Leland must
undoubtedly have had good authority for calling him “nobilis ille
exlex.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn13" id="fnanc13">13</a> Fordun
supposes him in the number of those deprived of their estates
by King Henry III. “Hoc intempore,” says he, “de exheredatis
surrexit &amp; caput erexit ille famosissimus siccarius Robertus
Hode &amp; littill Johanne cum eorum complicibus” (p. 774). The
Sloane MS. says he was “so ryotous that he lost or sould his
patrimony &amp; for debt became an outlawe;” and the Harleian
note mentions his “having wasted his estate in riotous courses.”
The former authority, however, gives a different, though, it may
be, less credible, account of his being obliged to abscond. It
is as follows: “One of his first exployts was the going abrode
into a forrest &amp; bearing with him a bowe of exceeding great
strength, he fell into company with certayne rangers or woodmen,
who fell to quarrel with him, as making showe to use such a bowe
as no man was able to shoote withall. Whereto Robin replyed that
he had two better then that at Lockesley, only he bare that with
him nowe as a byrding bowe. At length the ‘contention’ grewe so
hote that there was a wager layd about the kyllyng of a deere
a greate distance of, for performance whereof Robin offered to
lay his head to a certayne some of money, the advantage of which
rash speach the others presently tooke. So the marke being found
out, one of them, both to make his hart faynt and hand unsteady,
as he was about to shoote urged him with the losse of head if he
myst the marke. Notwithstanding Robyn kyld the deare, and gave
every man his <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxiv">{xxiv}</span> money
agayne, save to him which at the poynt of shooting so upbraided him
with danger to loose his hed for that wager; &amp; he sayd they
would drinke togeyther: whereupon the others stomached the matter
and from quarelling they grewe to fighting with him. But Robin,
getting him somewhat of, with shooting dispatch them, and so fled
away; and then betaking himselfe to lyve in the woods,” &amp;c.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn14" id="fnanc14">14</a></p>

<p>That he lurked or infested the woods is agreed by all.
“Circa hæc tempora,” says Major, “Robertus Hudus Anglus
&amp; parvus Joannes, latrones famatissimi, in nemoribus latuerunt.”</p>

<p>Dr. Stukeley says that “Robin Hood took to this wild way
of life in imitation of his grandfather Geoffrey de Mandeville,
who being a favorer of Maud empress, King Stephen took
him prisoner at S. Albans, and made him give up the tower
of London, Walden, Plessis, &amp;c., upon which he lived on
plunder” (MS. note in his copy of Robin Hood’s Garland).</p>

<p id="note07">(7)
<i>“Of these, he chiefly af­fect­ed Barns­dale,” &amp;c.</i>] “Along
on the lift hond,” says Leland, “a iii. miles of betwixt Milburne
and Feribridge I saw the wooddi and famose forrest of
Barnesdale, wher thay say that Robyn Hudde lyvid like an
outlaw” (Itinerary, v. 101).</p>

<p>“They haunted about Barnsdale forrest, Compton [r.
Plompton] parke,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn15" id="fnanc15">15</a> and such other places” (MS. Sloane).</p>

<p>“His principal residence,” says Fuller, “was in Shirewood
forrest in this county [Notts], though he had another haunt
(he is no fox that hath but one hole) near the sea in the
North Riding in Yorkshire, where Robin Hood’s Bay still retaineth
his name: not that he was any pirat, but a land-thief,
who retreated to those unsuspected parts for his security”
(Worthies of England, p. 320). <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxv">{xxv}</span></p>

<p>In Thoroton’s Not­ting­ham­shire, p. 505, is some account of
the ancient and present state of Sherwood forest; but one
looks in vain through that dry detail of land-owners for any
particulars relating to our hero. “In anno domini 1194,
King Richard the First, being a hunting in the forrest of Sherwood,
did chase a hart out of the forrest of Sherwood into
Barnesdale in Yorkshire, and because he could not there
recover him, he made proclamation at Tickill in Yorkshire,
and at divers other places there, that no person should kill,
hurt, or chase the said hart, but that he might safely retorne
into forrest againe, which hart was afterwards called a hart-royall
proclaimed” (Manwood’s Forest Laws, 1598, p. 25,
from “an auncient recorde” found by him in the tower of
Nottingham Castle).<a class="afnanc" href="#fn16" id="fnanc16">16</a></p>

<p id="note08">(8)
<i>“Here he either found,” &amp;c.</i>] After being outlawed,
Grafton tells us, “for a lewde shift, as his last refuge, [he]
gathered together a companye of roysters and cutters, and
practised robberyes and spoyling of the kinges subjects, and
occupied and frequented the forestes or wild countries.” See
also the following note.</p>

<p id="note09">(9)
“<i>Little John, William Scadlock, George a Green,
pinder of Wakefield, Much a miller’s son, and a certain monk
or frier named Tuck.</i>”] Of these, the pre-eminence is incontestably
due to Little John, whose name is almost constantly
coupled with that of his gallant leader. “Robertus Hode &amp;
littill Johanne,” are mentioned together by Fordun as early
as 1341; and later instances of the connection would be
almost endless. After the words, “for
debt became an <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxvi">{xxvi}</span>
outlaw,” the Sloane MS. adds: “then joyninge to him many
stout fellowes of lyke disposition, amongst whom one called
Little John was principal or next to him, they haunted about
Barnsdale forrest,” &amp;c. See Notes 39, 40.</p>

<p>With respect to Frier Tuck, “thogh some say he was an
other kynd of religious man, for that the order of freyrs was
not yet sprung up” (MS. Sloan.), yet as the Dominican friers
(or friers preachers) came into England in the year 1221, upward
of twenty years before the death of Robin Hood, and
several orders of these religious had flourished abroad for some
time, there does not seem much weight in that objection: nor,
in fact, can one pay much regard to the term frier, as it seems
to have been the common title given by the vulgar (more
especially after the Reformation) to all the regular clergy, of
which the friers were at once the lowest and most numerous.
If Frier Tuck be the same person who, in one of the oldest
songs, is called the curtail frier of Fountains-dale, he must
necessarily have been one of the monks of that abbey, which
was of the Cistercian order. However this may be, Frier
Tuck is frequently noticed by old writers as one of the companions
of Robin Hood, and as such was an essential character
in the morris-dance (see Note <a href="#note34" title="go to note 34">34</a>). He is thus mentioned
by Skelton, laureat, in his “goodly interlude” of
Magnificence, written about the year 1500, and with an evident
allusion to some game or practice now totally forgotten
and inexplicable:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Another
 bade shave halfe my berde,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And boyes to the pylery gan me plucke,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And wolde have made me freer Tucke,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To preche oute of the pylery hole.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>In the year 1417, as Stow relates, “one, by his counterfeite
name, called Frier Tucke, with manie other malefactors, committed
many robberies in the counties of Surrey &amp; Sussex,
whereupon the king sent out his writs for their apprehension”
(Annales, 1592).</p>

<p>George a Green is George o’ the green, meaning perhaps the
town-green, in which the pound or pinfold stood of which he had the
care. He has been particularly celebrated, and <span class="xxpn"
id="p-xxvii">{xxvii}</span> “As good as George a Green” is still
a common saying.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn17" id="fnanc17">17</a>
Drayton, describing the progress of the river Calder, in the West
Riding of Yorkshire, has the following lines:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>It
 chanc’d she in her course on ‘Kirkley’ cast her eye,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Beholding fitly too before how Wakefield stood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">She doth not only think of lusty Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">But of his merry man, the pindar of the town</div>
<div class="dpv00">Of Wakefield, George a Green, whose fames so far are blown</div>
<div class="dpv00">For their so valiant fight, that every freeman’s song</div>

<p class="pcontinue">Thus, too, Richard Brathwayte, in his poetical
epistle “to all true-bred northerne sparks of the generous society

<p>In the latter part of this extract, honest Richard evidently
alludes to “A pleasant conceyted comedie of George a Greene,
the pinner of Wakefield; as it was sundry times acted by the
servants of the right honourable the earle of Sussex,” 1599,
4to, which has been erroneously ascribed to Heywood the
epigrammatist, and is reprinted, with other trash, in the late
edition of Dodsley’s Old Plays; only it unluckily happens
that Robin Hood is almost the only person who has no difference
with the souter (or shoemaker) of Bradford. The
play, in short (or at least that part of it which we have any
concern with), is founded on the ballad of Robin Hood and
the Pinder of Wakefield (see part ii. song 3), which it directly
quotes, and is, in fact, a most despicable performance.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn18" id="fnanc18">18</a> King
Edward (the Fourth) having taken King James of Scotland
prisoner, after a most bloody battle near Middleham Castle,
from which of 30,000 Scots not 5000 had escaped, comes
with his royal captive in disguise to
Bradford, where they <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxix">{xxix}</span>
meet Robin Hood and George a Green, who have just had a
stout affray: and after having read this, and a great deal
more such nonsensical stuff, Captain Grose sagaciously “supposes
that this play has little or no foundation in history;”
and very gravely sits down and debates his opinion in form.</p>

<p>“The history of George a Green, pindar of the town of
Wakefield,” 4to, no date,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn19" id="fnanc19">19</a> is a modern production, chiefly
founded on the old play just mentioned, of neither authority
nor merit.</p>

<p>As no mention is made of Adam Bell, Clim of the Clough,

more than one of the numerous songs of Robin Hood, nor
does the name of the latter once occur in the old metrical
history of those famous archers reprinted in Percy’s Reliques,
and among pieces of ancient popular poetry, it is to be concluded
that they flourished at different periods, or at least
had no connection with each other. In a poem, however,
intitled, “Adam Bell, Clim of the Clough, and young William
of Cloudesley, the second part,” 1616, 4to, b. l. (Bib. Bod.
Art. L. 71, being a more modern copy than that in Selden C.

“<i>Marian.</i>”] Who or whatever this lady was, it is
observable that no mention of her occurs either in the Lytell
Geste of Robyn Hode, or in any other
poem or song <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxxi">{xxxi}</span>
concerning him, except the not very old ballad of Robin Hood’s
Golden Prize, where she is barely named, and a still more
modern one of no merit (see part ii. song 24).<a class="afnanc" href="#fn21" id="fnanc21">21</a> She is an
important character, however, in the two old plays of The
death and downfall of Robert earl of Hun­ting­ton, written
before 1600, and is frequently mentioned by dramatic or
other writers about that period. Her presence, likewise,
was considered as essential to the morris-dance. See Note
<a href="#note34" title="go to note 34">34</a>.</p>

<p>In the <i>First Part of King Henry IV.</i> Falstaff says to the

for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the deputy’s wife of
the ward to thee;” upon which Dr. Johnson observes, that
“Maid Marian is a man dressed like a woman, who attends
the dancers of the morris.” “In the ancient songs of Robin

Marian, who appears to have been his concubine. I could

<p>Mr. Steevens, too, after citing the old play of “The downfall
of Robert earl of Hun­ting­ton,” 1601, to prove “that Maid Marian
was originally a name assumed by Matilda, the daughter of Robert,
Lord Fitzwater, while Robin Hood remained in a state of outlawry,”
observes, that “Shakespeare speaks of Maid Marian in her degraded
state, when she was <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxxii">{xxxii}</span>
represented by a strumpet or a clown;” and refers to figure 2 in
the plate at the end of the play, with Mr. Tollet’s observations
on it. The widow, in Sir W. Davenant’s “Love and Honour,” says, “I
have been Mistress Marian in a maurice ere now;” and Mr. Warton<a

piece, entitled “Old Meg of Here­ford­shire for a Maid Marian,
and Hereford town for a morris-dance: or 12 morris-dancers in
Here­ford­shire of 1200 years old,” London, 1609, 4to, which is

country.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn24" id="fnanc24">24</a> See Note

encreast to an hundred and a halfe.”</p>

Sloane manuscript; which adds: “after such maner he
procured the pynner of Wakefeyld to become one of his

he induced upon this occasion: one day meeting him as he

Lytell Geste of Robyn Hode turned into prose, appears to
have been written before the year 1600.</p>

<i>“In shooting,” &amp;c.</i>] MS. Sloan. Grafton also speaks
of our hero’s “excellyng principally in archery or shooting,
his manly courage agreeyng thereunto.”</p>

<p>Their archery, indeed, was unparalleled, as both Robin
Hood and Little John have frequently shot an arrow a measured
mile, or 1760 yards, which it is supposed no one,
either before or since, was ever able to do. “Tradition,”
says Master Charlton, “informs us that in one of ‘Robin
Hood’s’ peregrinations, he, attended by his trusty mate Little
John, went to dine [at Whitby Abbey] with the abbot Richard,
who, having heard them often famed for their great dexterity
in shooting with the long bow, begged them after dinner to
shew him a specimen thereof; when, to oblige the abbot,
they went up to the top of the abbey, whence each of them
shot an arrow, which fell not far from Whitby-laths, but on
the contrary side of the lane; and in memorial thereof, a
pillar was set up by the abbot in the place where each of the
arrows was found, which are yet standing in these our days;
that field where the pillar for Robin Hood’s arrow stands
being still called Robin Hood’s field, and the other where
the pillar for Little John’s arrow is placed, still preserving
the name of John’s field. Their distance from Whitby Abbey
is more than a measured mile, which seems very far for the
flight of an arrow, and is a circumstance that will stagger
the faith of many; but as to the credibility of the story,
every reader may judge thereof as he thinks proper; only I
must here beg leave to observe that these very pillars are
mentioned, and the fields called by the aforesaid names, in
the old deeds for that ground, now in the possession of Mr.
Thomas Watson” (History of Whitby, York,
1779, p. 146).<a class="afnanc" href="#fn25" id="fnanc25">25</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxxiv">{xxxiv}</span></p>

<p>Dr. Meredith Hanmer, in his Chronicle of Ireland (p. 179),
speaking of Little John, says, “There are memorable acts reported
of him, which I hold not for truth, that he would shoot an arrow
a mile off and a great deale more; but them,” adds he, “I leave
among the lyes of the land.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn26"

“<i>An outlaw, in those times, being deprived of protection,
owed no allegiance,” &amp;c.</i>] Such a character was, doubtless,
at the period treated of, in a very critical situation; it being
equally as legal and meritorious to hunt down and dispatch him as
it was to kill a wolf, the head of which animal he was said to
bear. “Item foris facit,” says Bracton (who wrote about the time),
“omnia que pacis sunt, quia a tempore quo utlagatus est caput gerit
lupinum, ita ut impune ab omnibus interfici possit” (l. 2, c. 35).
In the great roll of the exchequer, in the 7th year of King Richard
I., is an allowance by writ of two marks to Thomas de Prestwude,
for bringing to Westminster the head of William de Elleford, an
outlaw. (See Madox’s History of the Exchequer, 136.) Those who
received or consorted with a person outlawed were subject to the
same punishment. Such was the humane policy of our enlightened
ancestors! See Note <a href="#note21" title="go to note 21">21</a>.</p>

<p>It has been conjectured, however, that, in the winter season,
our hero and his companions severally quartered themselves
in villages or country-houses more or less remote, with
persons of whose fidelity they were assured. It is not improbable,
at the same time, that they might have tolerably
comfortable habitations erected in the woods.</p>

<p>Archery, which our hero and his companions appear to
have carried to a state of perfection, continued to be cultivated
for some ages after their time, down, indeed, to that of Henry
VIII., or about the year 1540, when, owing to the introduction
of artillery and matchlock-guns, it became neglected,
and the bowmen of Cressy and Agincourt utterly extinct;
though it may be still a question whether a body of expert
archers would not, even at this day, be superior
to an equal <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxxvii">{xxxvii}</span>
number armed with muskets.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn28" id="fnanc28">28</a> The loss sustained from
this change by the people at large seems irreparable. Anciently,
the use of the bow or bill qualified every man for a
soldier; and a body of peasants, led on by a Tyler or a Cade,
was not less formidable than any military force that could be
raised to oppose them: by which means the people from
time to time preserved the very little liberty they had, and
which their tyrants were constantly endeavouring to wrest
from them. See how the case stands at present: the sovereign,
let him be who or what he will (kings have been tyrants, and
may be so again), has a standing army, well disciplined and
accoutred, while the subjects or people are absolutely defenceless:
as much care having been taken, particularly since
“the glorious revolution,” to deprive them of arms as was
formerly bestowed to enforce their use and practice.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn29" id="fnanc29">29</a> The
following extract from Hale’s Historia Placitorum Coronæ
(i. 118) will serve to show how familiar the bow and arrow
was in the 14th century:—“M. 22. E. 3. Rot. 117. coram
rege Ebor. This was the case of Henry Vescy, who had
been indicted before the sheriff in turno suo .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of divers
felonies, whereupon the sheriff mandavit commissionem suam
Henrico de Clyderawe &amp; aliis ad capiendum prædictum H.
Vescy, &amp; salvo ducendum usque castrum de Ebor.” Vescy
would not submit to an arrest, but fled, and inter fugiendum
shot with his bow and arrows at his pursuers, but in the end
was killed by Clyderawe: to which may be added a remarkable
passage in Harison’s “Description of England” (prefixed
to Holinshed’s Chronicle, 1587), to prove how much it
had declined in the 16th. “In times past,”
says he, “the <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxxviii">{xxxviii}</span>
cheefe force of England consisted in their long bowes. But
now we have in maner generallie given over that kind of
artillerie, and for long bowes in deed doo practise to shoot
compasse for our pastime; which kind of shooting can never
yeeld anie smart stroke, nor beat down our enemies, as our
countrymen were woont to doo at everie time of need.
Certes the Frenchmen and Rutters,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn30" id="fnanc30">30</a> deriding our new
archerie in respect of their corslets, will not let, in open
skirmish, if anie leisure serve, to turne up their tailes, and
crie, Shoote, English; and all because our strong shooting is
decaied and laid in bed. But if some of our Englishmen
now lived that served King Edward the Third in his warres
with France, the breech<a class="afnanc" href="#fn31" id="fnanc31">31</a> of such a varlet should have beene
nailed to his bum with one arrow, and an other fethered in
his bowels, before he should have turned about to see who
shot the first” (p. 198). Bishop Latimer, in his sixth sermon
before King Edward VI., gives an interesting account how the
sons of yeomen were, in his infancy, trained up to the bow.
“But now,” says he, “we have taken up whooring in townes,
instead of shooting in the fieldes.”</p>

the best blue. <span class="xxpn" id="p-xxxix">{xxxix}</span>
See Ray’s Proverbs, p. 178. Kendal green is equally famous,
and appears to have been cloth of a similar quality. This
colour was adopted by foresters to prevent their being too
readily discovered by the deer. See Sir John Wynne’s History
of the Guedir Family (Barrington’s Miscellanies), p. 419.
Thus the Scotish Highlanders used to wear brown plaids to
prevent their being distinguished among the heath. It is
needless to observe that green has ever been the favourite
dress of an archer, hunter, &amp;c. See Note

<p>Lincoln green was well known in France in or before the 13th
century. Thus, in an old fabliau, transprosed by M. Le Grand
(Fabliaux ou Contes, iv. 13), “Il mit donc son surcot fourré
d’écureuil, et sa belle robe d’Estanfort teinte en verd.” Estanfort
is Stamford, in Lincolnshire.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn34"
id="fnanc34">34</a> This cloth is, likewise, often mentioned by the
old Scotish poets under the names of Lincum licht, Lincum twyne,
&amp;c., and appears to have been in universal request: and yet,
notwithstanding this cloud of evidence, Mr. Pinkerton has had the
confidence to assert that “no particular cloth was ever made at
Lincoln.” (See Ancient Scotish Poems, ii. 430.) But, indeed, this
worthy gentleman, as Johnson said of Goldsmith, only stumbles upon
truth by accident. <span class="xxpn" id="p-xl">{xl}</span></p>

<p>“But who,” exclaims Dr. Fuller, having cited this passage, “made
him a judge? or gave him a commission to take where it might be
best spared, and give where it was most wanted?” That same power,
one may answer, which authorises kings to take where it can be
worst spared, and give it where it is least wanted. Our hero, in
this respect, was a knight-errant; and wanted no other commission
than that of Justice, whose cause he militated. His power,
compared with that of the king of England, was by no means either
equally usurped or equally abused: the one reigned over subjects
(or slaves) as a master (or tyrant), the other possessed no
authority but what was delegated to him by the free suffrage of his
adherents, for their general good: and as for the rest, it would
be absurd to blame in Robin what we should praise in Richard.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn35" id="fnanc35">35</a> The latter, too,
warred in remote parts of the world against nations from which
neither he nor his subjects had sustained any injury; the former
at home against those to whose wealth, avarice, or ambition he
might fairly attribute not only his own misfortunes, but the misery
of the oppressed and enslaved society he had quitted. In a word,
every man who has the power has also the authority to pursue the
ends of justice, to regulate the gifts of fortune, by transferring
the superfluities of the rich to the necessities of the poor; by
relieving the oppressed, and even, when necessary, destroying
the oppressor. These are the objects of the social union, and
every individual may, and to the utmost of his power should,
endeavour to promote them. Had our Robin Hood been, like M’Donald
of Barrisdale, a reader of Virgil, he, as well as that gallant
chief, might have inscribed on his baldric— <span class="xxpn"

that he “practised robberyes,” &amp;c., adds, “The which beyng
certefyed to the king, and he beyng greatly offended therewith,
caused his proclamation to be made that whosoever
would bryng him quicke or dead, the king would geve him a

“<i>At length the infirmities of old age increasing upon
him</i>,” <i>&amp;c.</i>] Thus Grafton: “The sayd Robert Hood, beyng
troubled with sicknesse, came to a certain nonry in Yorkshire
called Bircklies [r. Kircklies], where desiryng to be let
blood, he was betrayed and bled to death.” The Sloane
MS. says that “[Being] dystempered with could and age,
he had great payne in his lymmes, his bloud being corrupted,
therefore to be eased of his payne by letting bloud, he repayred
to the priores of Kyrkesly, which some say was his aunt, a
woman very skylful in physique &amp; surgery; who, perceyving
him to be Robyn Hood, &amp; waying howe fel an enimy he
was to religious persons, toke reveng of him for her owne
howse and all others by letting him bleed to death. It is
also sayd that one Sir Roger of Doncaster, bearing grudge to
Robyn for some injury, incyted the priores, with whome he
was very familiar, in such a maner to dispatch him.” See
the Lytell Geste of Robyn Hode, ad finem. The Harleian
MS., after mentioning the proclamation “sett furth to have
him apprehended,” adds, “At which time it happened he fell
sick at a nunnery in Yorkshire called Birkleys [r. Kirkleys];
&amp; desiring there to be let blood, hee was betrayed &amp; made
bleed to death.”</p>

<p>Kirkleys, Kirklees, or Kirkleghes, formerly
Kuthale, in the <span class="xxpn" id="p-xlv">{xlv}</span>
deanery of Pontefract, and archdeaconry of the West Riding of
Yorkshire, was a Cistercian, or, as some say, a Benedictine
nunnery, founded, in honour of the Virgin Mary and St.
James, by Reynerus Flandrensis in the reign of King Henry
II. Its revenues at the dissolution were somewhat about
£20, and the site was granted (36 Hen. 8.) to John Tasburgh
and Henry Savill, from whom it came to one of the ancestors
of Sir George Armytage, Bart., the present possessor. The
remains of the building (if any) are very inconsiderable, and
its register has been searched after in vain. See Tanner’s
Notitia, p. 674. Thoresby’s Ducatus Leodiensis, p. 91.
Hearne’s “Account of Several Antiquities in and about the
University of Oxford,” at the end of Leland’s Itinerary, vol.
ii. p. 128.</p>

<p>In 1706 was discovered, among the ruins of the nunnery,
the monument of Elisabeth de Staynton, prioress; but it is
not certain that this was the lady from whom our hero experienced
such kind assistance. See Thoresby and Hearne
ubi supra.</p>

<p>“One may wonder,” says Dr. Fuller, “how he escaped
the hand of justice, dying in his bed, for ought is found to the
contrary; but it was because he was rather a merry than a
mischievous thief (complementing passengers out of their
purses), never murdering any but deer, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘feasting’
the vicinage with his vension” (Worthies, p. 320). See the
following note.</p>

<p>According to the Sloane MS., the prioress, after “letting
him bleed to death, buryed him under a great stone by the
hywayes syde;” which is agreeable to the account in Grafton’s
Chronicle, where it is said that, after his death, “the prioresse
of the same place caused him to be buried by the highway-side,
where he had used to rob and spoyle those that passed
that way. And vpon his grave the sayde prioresse did lay a
very fayre stone, wherein the names of Robert Hood, William
of Goldesborough, and others were graven. And the cause
why she buryed him there was, for that the common passengers
and travailers, knowyng and seeyng him there buryed,
might more safely and without feare take their jorneys
that way, which they durst not do in the life of the sayd
outlawes. And at eyther ende of the sayde tombe was
erected a crosse of stone, which is to be seene there at this
present.”</p>

<p>“Near unto ‘Kirklees’ the noted Robin Hood lies buried
under a grave-stone that yet remains near the park, but the
inscription scarce legible” (Thoresby’s Ducatus Leodiensis,
fo. 1715, p. 91). In the Appendix, p.
576, is the following
note, with a reference to “page
<span class="nowrap">91:”—</span></p>

<p>“Amongst the papers of the learned Dr. Gale, late dean
of Yorke, was found this epitaph of Robin Hood:</p>

<div class="dctr03">
<img src="images/p-xlvi.jpg" width="795" height="361" alt="Hear
undernead dis laitl stean laiz robert earl of Huntingtun nea arcir
ver az hie sa geud an pipl kauld im robin heud sick utlawz az hi an
iz men vil england nivr si agen.

obiit 24 [r. 14] kal dekembris 1247.”" /></div>

<p id="p-xlvii">The genuineness of this epitaph has been questioned. Dr.
Percy, in the first edition of his “Reliques of Ancient English
Poetry” (1765), says “It must be confessed this epitaph
is suspicious, because in the most ancient poems of
Robin Hood there is no mention of this imaginary earldom.”
This reason, however, is by no means conclusive, the most
ancient poem now extant having no pretension to the antiquity
claimed by the epitaph: and indeed the Doctor himself
should seem to have afterward had less confidence in it, as,
in both the subsequent editions, those words are omitted,
and the learned critic merely observes that the epitaph appears
to him suspicious. It will be admitted that the bare
suspicion of this ingenious writer, whose knowledge and
judgment of ancient poetry are so conspicuous and eminent,
ought to have considerable weight. As for the present
editor’s part, though he does not pretend to say that the language
of this epitaph is that of Henry the Third’s time, nor
indeed to determine of what age it is, he can perceive nothing
in it from whence one should be led to pronounce it spurious,
<i>i.e.</i> that it was never inscribed on the grave-stone of Robin
Hood. That there actually was some inscription upon it
in Thoresby’s time, though then scarce legible, is evident
from his own words: and it should be remembered as well
that the last century was not the era of imposition, as that
Dr. Gale was both too good and too learned a man either to
be capable of it himself or to be liable to it from others.</p>

<p>That industrious chronologist and topographer, as well as
respectable artist and citizen, master Thomas Gent, of York,
in his “List of religious houses,” annexed to “The ancient
and modern state of” that famous city, 1730, 12mo, p. 234,
informs us that he had been told “that his [Robin Hood’s]
tombstone, having his effigy thereon, was order’d, not many
years ago, by a certain knight to be placed as a harth-stone
in his great hall. When it was laid overnight, the next morning
it was ‘surprizingly’ removed [on or to]
one side; and <span class="xxpn" id="p-xlviii">{xlviii}</span>
so three times it was laid, and as successively turned aside.
The knight, thinking he had done wrong to have brought it
thither, order’d it should be drawn back again; which was
performed by a pair of oxen and four horses, when twice the
number could scarce do it before. But as this,” adds the
sagacious writer, “is a story only, it is left to the reader to
judge at pleasure.” N.B.—This is the second instance of a
miracle wrought in favour of our hero!</p>

<p>In Gough’s Sepulchral Monuments, p. cviii., is “the figure
of the stone over the grave of Robin Hood [in Kirklees park,
being a plain stone with a sort of cross fleuree thereon], now
broken and much defaced, the inscription illegible. That
printed in Thoresby, Ducat. Leod. 576, from Dr. Gale’s
papers, was never on it.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn38" id="fnanc38">38</a> The late Sir Samuel Armitage
owner of the premises, caused the ground under it to be dug
a yard deep, and found it had never been disturbed; so
that it was probably brought from some other place, and by
vulgar tradition ascribed to Robin Hood” (refers to “Mr.
Watson’s letter in Antiquary Society minutes”). This is probably
the tomb-stone of Elizabeth de Staynton, mentioned in
the preceding note.</p>

<p>The old epitaph is, by some anonymous hand, in a work
entitled “Sepulchrorum inscriptiones; or a curious collection
of 900 of the most remarkable epitaphs,” Westminster, 1727
(vol. ii. p. 73), thus not inelegantly paraphrased:</p>

<p>These two plays, usually called the first and second part of
Robin Hood, were always, on the authority of Kirkman, falsely
ascribed to Thomas Heywood, till Mr. Malone fortunately retrieved
the names of the true authors, Anthony Mundy and Henry Chettle.<a

founded on traditions long since forgotten, and refer occasionally

<p>The first part, or downfall of Robert earle of Hun­ting­ton,

<p>After some Skeltonical rimes, and a scene betwixt the
prior, the sheriff, and justice Warman, concerning the outlawry,
which appears to be proclaimed, and the taking of
Earl Hun­ting­ton at dinner, “Enter Robin Hoode, little John
following him; Robin having his napkin on his shoulder, as
if hee were sodainly raised from dinner.” He is in a violent
rage at being outlawed, and Little John endeavours to pacify
him. Marian being distressed at his apparent disorder, he
dissembles with her. After she is gone, John thus addresses
him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The company now enters, and Robin charges them with
the conspiracy, and rates their treacherous proceedings. Little
John in attempting to remove the goods is set upon by Warman
and the sheriff; and during the fray “Enter Prince John,
Ely and the prior, and others.” Little John tells the prince
he but defends the box containing his own gettings; upon
which his royal highness observes,</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="dpv00">A simple yeoman as his servants were.”</div>

<p>Ely gives the prior his commission, with directions to make
speed, lest “in his country-house all his heards be solde;”
and gives Warman a patent “for the high sheriffewick of
Nottingham.” After this, “Enter Robin like a citizen; and
then the queen and Marian disguised for each other. Robin
takes Marian, and leaves the queen to Prince
John, who is <span class="xxpn" id="p-liv">{liv}</span>
so much enraged at the deception that he breaks the head of
Ely’s messenger. Sir Hugh, brother to Lord Lacy, and steward
to Ely, who had been deeply concerned in Hun­ting­ton’s
ruin, is killed in a brawl by Prince John, whom Ely orders
to be arrested; but the prince, producing letters from the
king revoking Ely’s appointment, “lifts up his drawne
sworde,” and “Exit, cum Lester and Lacy,” in triumph.
Then “Enter Robin Hoode, Matilda at one doore, little

sheriff insists that Ralph shall serve the turn, which he refuses.
In the midst of the altercation, “Enter Robin Hoode, like an

<p class="dclearfix">In the next scene, we find Frier Tucke feignedly entering
into a conspiracy with the prior and Sir Doncaster to serve
an execution on Robin in disguise. Jinny, the widow
Scarlet’s daughter, coming in on her way to Sherwood, is
persuaded by the frier to accompany him, “disguised in
habit like a pedler’s mort.” Fitzwater enters like an old man:—sees
Robin sleeping on a green bank, Marian strewing
flowers on him; pretends to be blind and hungry, and is
regaled by them. In answer to a question why the fair
Matilda (Fitzwater’s daughter) had changed her name, Robin
tells him it is</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Because
 she lives a spotlesse maiden life:</div>
<div class="dpv00">And shall, till Robin’s outlawe life have ende,</div>
<div class="dpv00">That he may lawfully take her to wife;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Which, if King Richard come, will not be long.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>“Enter Frier Tucke and Jinny like pedlers singing,” and
afterward “Sir Doncaster and others weaponed.” The frier
discovers the plot, and a fray ensues. The scene then changes
to the court, where the prior is informed of six of his barns
being destroyed by fire, and of the different execrations of all
ranks upon him, as the undoer of “the good lord Robert,
earle of Hun­ting­ton;” that the convent of St. Mary’s had
elected “Olde father Jerome” prior in his place; and lastly,
a herald brings his sentence of banishment, which is confirmed
by the entrance of the prior. Lester brings an account of the
imprisonment of his gallant sovereign, King Richard, by the
Duke of Austria, and requires his ransom to be sent. He
then introduces a description of his matchless valour in the
Holy Land. John not only refuses the ransom-money, but
usurps the style of king; upon which Lester
grows furious, <span class="xxpn" id="p-lix">{lix}</span>
and rates the whole company. The following is part of the
dialogue:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv01">“<i>Joh.</i> (<i>to Lester</i>). Darest thou attempt thus
 proudly in our sight?</div>
<div class="dpv01"><i>Lest.</i> What is’t a subject dares, that I dare not?</div>
<div class="dpv01"><i>Sals.</i> Dare subjects dare, their soveraigne being by?</div>
<div class="dpv01"><i>Lest.</i> O God, that my true soveraigne were ny!</div>

<div class="dpv01"><i>Lest.</i> A plague of reverence!”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>After this, and more on the same subject, the scene returns
to the forest, where Ely, being taken by Much, “like a
countryman with a basket,” is examined and detected by
Robin, who promises him protection and service. On their
departure:</p>

<blockquote>

</div></div></blockquote>

<p>“Enter Warman banished.” He laments his fall, and applies to a
cousin, on whom he had bestowed large possessions, for relief; but
receives nothing, except reproaches for his treachery to his noble
master. The jailor of Nottingham, who was indebted to him for his
place, refuses him even a scrap of his dog’s meat, and reviles
him in the severest terms. Good-wife Tomson, whose husband he had
delivered from death, to his great joy, promises him a caudle, but
<span class="xxpn" id="p-lx">{lx}</span> fetches him a halter,<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn45" id="fnanc45">45</a> in which he is
about to hang himself, but is prevented by Fitzwater, and some of
Robin Hood’s men, who crack a number of jokes upon him; Robin puts
an end to their mockery, and proffers him comfort and favour. Then
enters Frier Tucke, with an account of Sir Doncaster and the prior
being stripped and wounded in their way to Bawtrey: Robin, out of
love to his uncle, hastens to the place. After this “Enter Prince
John, solus, in green, bowe and arrowes.</p>

<p class="pcontinue">He assumes the name of Woodnet, and is detected by Scathlocke
and Frier Tucke. The prince and Scathlocke fight,
Scathelocke grows weary, and the frier takes his place.
Marion enters, and perceiving the frier, parts the combatants.
Robin enters, and John submits to him. Much enters,
running, with information of the approach of “the king and
twelve and twenty score of horses.” Robin places his people
in order. The trumpets sound, the king and his train enter,
a general pardon ensues, and the king confirms the love of
Robin and Matilda. Thus the play concludes, Skelton
promising the second part, and acquainting the audience of
what it should consist.</p>

<p>The second part, or death of Robert earle of Hun­ting­ton,
is a pursuit of the same story. The scene, so far as our
hero is concerned, lyes in Sherwood. A few extracts may
not be unacceptable. <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxi">{lxi}</span></p>

<p>“Sc. iiii. Winde hornes. Enter king, queene, &amp;c. Frier
Tuck carrying a stag’s head, dauncing.” The frier has been
sent for to read the following incription upon a copper ring
round the stag’s neck:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>When

</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">The king orders “head, ring, and all” to be sent to Nottingham
Castle, to be kept for monuments. Fitzwater tells him he
has heard “an olde tale,”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The next quotation may be of service to Dr.
Percy, who <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxiii">{lxiii}</span>
has been pleased to question our hero’s nobility, because
“the most ancient poems make no mention of this earldom,”
and the old legend expressly asserts him “to have been a
yeoman.” It is very true; and we shall here not only find
his title established, but also discover the secret of his not
being usually distinguished or designed by it.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft">
<div class="dstanzalft">

</div></div></blockquote>

<p>Now, the reason that “the most ancient poems make no
mention of this earldom,” and the old legend expressly
asserts him “to have been a yeoman,” appears, plainly
enough, to be, that as, pursuant to his own injunction, he
was never called, either by his followers, or in the vicinity,
by any other name than Robin Hood, so particularly the
minstrels, who were always, no doubt, welcome
to Sherwood,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn49" id="fnanc49">49</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxiv">{lxiv}</span>
and liberally entertained by him and his yeomanry, would
take special care never to offend against the above law:
which puts an end to the dispute.—Q. E. D.</p>

<p>Our hero is, at length, poisoned by a drink which Doncaster
and the prior, his uncle, had prepared for him to give
to the king. His departing scene and last dying speech are
beautiful and pathetic.</p>

<p>The poet then prosecutes the legend of Matilda, who is
finally poisoned, by the procurement of King John, in Dunmow
Priory.</p>

<p>The story of this lady, whom the author of these plays is
supposed to have been the first that converted into the character
of Maid Marian, or connected in any shape with the history
of Robin Hood, is thus related by Stow, under the year
1213: “The chronicle of Dunmow sayth, this discord arose
betwixt the king and his barons, because of Mawd called the
faire, daughter to Robert Fitzwalter, whome the king loved,
but her father would not consent; and thereupon ensued
warre throughout England. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Whilst Mawd the faire
remayned at Dunmow, there came a messenger unto her
from King John about his suite in love, but because she would
not agree, the messenger poysoned a boyled or potched egge
against she was hungrie, whereof she died” (Annales, 1592).
Two of Drayton’s heroical epistles pass between King John
and Matilda. He has also written her legend.</p>

<p>This is one of the pageants formerly usual on Lord Mayor’s
day, and of which several are extant, written as well by our
author Mundy,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn51" id="fnanc51">51</a> as by Middleton, Dekker, Heywood, and
other hackney dramatists of that period. They were thought
of such consequence that the City had for some time (though
probably not till after the Restoration) a professed laureat for
their composition; an office which expired with Elkanah
Settle in 1723–24. They consisted chiefly of machinery, allegorical
or historical personages, songs and speeches.</p>

<p>“After all these shewes, thus ordered in their appointed
places, followeth another device of huntsmen, all clad in
greene, with their bowes, arrowes and bugles, and a new
slaine deere, carried among them. It savoureth of earle
Robert de la Hude, sometime the noble earle of Hun­ting­ton,

followed his downecast fortunes; as little John, Scathlocke,
Much the miller’s son, Right-hitting Brand, fryar Tuck, and
many more. In which condition of life we make instant use
of him, and part of his brave bowmen, fitted with bowes and
arrowes, of the like strength and length,

deere.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>6. “Robin Hood and his pastoral May games.” 1624.</p>

<p>7. “Robin Hood and his crew of soldiers.” 1627.</p>

<p>These two titles are inserted among the plays mentioned
by Chetwood in his British Theatre (p. 67) as written by
anonymous authors in the 16th century to the Restoration.
But neither Langbaine, who mentions both, nor any other
person, pretends to have ever seen either of them. The
former, indeed, may possibly be
“The playe of Robyn <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxix">{lxix}</span>
Hode,” already noticed; and the other is probably a future
article. Langbaine, it is to be observed, gives no date to
either piece; so that it may be fairly concluded those above
specified are of Chetwood’s own invention, which appears to
have been abundantly fertile in every species of forgery and
imposture.</p>

<p>8. “The sad shepherd, or a tale of Robin Hood.”</p>

<p>The story of our renowned archer cannot be said to have
been wholly occupied by bards without a name, since, not
to mention Mundy or Drayton, the celebrated Ben Jonson
intended a pastoral drama on this subject, under the above
title; but dying, in the year 1637, before it was finished,
little more than the two first acts have descended down to us.
His last editor (Mr. Whalley), while he regrets that it is but
a fragment, speaks of it in raptures, and, indeed, not without
evident reason, many passages being eminently poetical and
judicious.</p>

<p>“The persons of the play,” so far as concerns our immediate
purpose, are: [1] “Robin Hood, the chief woodman [i.e. forester],
master of the feast. [2] Marian, his lady, the mistress. [3] Friar
Tuck, the chaplain and steward. [4] Little John, bow-bearer.
[5, 6] Scarlet, Scathlocke,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn53"
id="fnanc53">53</a> two brothers, huntsmen. [7] George a Green,
huisher of the bower. [8] Much, Robin Hood’s bailiff or acater.”
The rest are the guests invited, the witch of Paplewick, her
daughter, the swin’ard her son, Puck Hairy or Robin Goodfellow,
their hind, and lastly a devout hermit. “The scene, Sherwood,
consisting of a landscape of a forest, hills, valleys, cottages,
a castle, a river, pastures, herds, flocks, all full of country
simplicity; Robin Hood’s bower, his well, &amp;c.” “The argument
of the first act” is as follows: “Robin Hood, having invited
all the shepherds and shepherdesses of the vale of Be’voir to a
feast in the forest of Sherwood, and trusting to his mistress,
Maid Marian, with her woodmen, to kill him venison against the
day; having left the like charge with Friar Tuck, his chaplain and
steward, to command the rest of his merry men to see the bower made
<span class="xxpn" id="p-lxx">{lxx}</span> ready, and all things
in order for the entertainment: ‘meets’ with his guests at their
entrance into the wood, and conducts them to his bower: where, by
the way, he receives the relation of the sad shepherd Æglamour,
who is fallen into a deep melancholy for the loss of his beloved
Earine, reported to have been drowned in passing over the Trent,
some few days before. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the meantime Marian
is come from hunting. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Robin Hood inquires
if she hunted the deere at force, and what sport he made? how long
he stood? and what head he bore? all which is briefly answered,
with a relation of breaking him up, and the raven, and her bone.
The suspect had of that raven to be Maudlin the witch of Paplewick,
whom one of the huntsmen met i’ the morning at the rousing of the
deer, and is confirmed by her being then in Robin Hood’s kitchen,
i’ the chimney corner, broiling the same bit which was thrown
to the raven at the quarry or fall of the deer. Marian, being
gone in to shew the deer to some of the shepherdesses, returns
discontented; sends away the venison she had killed to her they
call the witch; quarrels with her love Robin Hood, abuseth him,
and his guests the shepherds; and so departs, leaving them all in
wonder and perplexity.”</p>

<p>By “the argument of the second act” it appears that the
witch had “taken the shape of Marian to abuse Robin Hood
and perplex his guests.” However, upon an explanation of
the matter with the true Marian, the trick is found out, the
venison recovered, and “Robin Hood dispatches out his
woodmen to hunt and take her: which ends the act.” The
third act was designed to be taken up with the chase of the
witch, her various schemes to elude the pursuers, and the
discovery of Earine in the swineherd’s enchanted oak. Nothing
more of the author’s design appearing, we have only to
regret the imperfect state of a pastoral drama, which, according
to the above learned and ingenious editor, would have
done honour to the nation.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn54" id="fnanc54">54</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxi">{lxxi}</span></p>

<p>9. “Robin Hood and his crew of souldiers, a comedy

corronation. Vivat rex. The actors names: Robin Hood,
commander; Little John, William Scadlocke, souldiers;
messenger from the sheriffe. London, printed for James
Davis, 1661.” 4to.</p>

<p>This is an interlude, of a few pages and no merit, alluding
to the late rebellion, and the subject of the day. The outlaws,
convinced by the reasoning of the sheriff’s messenger, become
loyal subjects.</p>

<p>This was a ballad-farce, acted at Drury-lane Theatre, in
which the following favourite song was originally sung by
Mr. Beard, in the character of Robin Hood:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<div class="dpv02">So blithe we’ll wake the morn;</div>

<div class="dpv02">No shaft shall fly in vain.</div>

<p>12. “Robin Hood; or Sherwood forest: a comic opera.
As performed at the theatre-royal in Covent-garden. By
Leonard Mac Nally, esq.” 1784. 8vo. <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxii">{lxxii}</span></p>

<p>This otherwise insignificant performance was embellished
with some fine music by Mr. Shield. It has been since reduced
to, and is still frequently acted as, an after-piece.</p>

<p>A drama on the subject of Robin Hood, under the title of
The Foresters, has been long expected from the elegant author
of The School for Scandal. The first act, said to have been
written many years ago, is, by those who have seen or heard
it, spoken of with admiration.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn55" id="fnanc55">55</a></p>

<p id="note27">(27)&#x2005;—“<i>innumerable
poems, rimes, songs and ballads.</i>”]
The original and most ancient pieces of this nature have all
perished in the lapse of time, during a period of between five
and six hundred years’ continuance; and all we now know
of them is that such things once existed. In the Vision of
Pierce Plowman, an allegorical poem, thought to have been
composed soon after the year 1360, and generally ascribed
to Robert Langeland, the author introduces an ignorant, idle,
and drunken secular priest, the representative, no doubt, of
the parochial clergy of that age, in the character of Sloth,
who makes the following confession:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>I
 cannot parfitli mi paternoster, as the preist it singeth,</div>
<div class="dpv00">But I can ryms of Roben Hode, and ‘Randolf’ erl of Chester,</div>
<div class="dpv00">But of our lorde or our lady I lerne nothyng at all.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn56" id="fnanc56">56</a></div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxiii">{lxxiii}</span></div>

<p>Fordun, the Scotish historian, who wrote about 1340,
speaking of Robin Hood and Little John, and their accomplices,
says, “of whom the foolish vulgar in comedies and
tragedies make lewd entertainment, and are delighted to hear
the jesters and minstrels sing them above all other ballads;”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn57" id="fnanc57">57</a>
and Mair (or Major), whose history was published by himself
in 1521, observes that “The exploits of this Robert are
celebrated in songs throughout all Britain.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn58" id="fnanc58">58</a> So, likewise,
Maister Johne Bellendene, the translator of “that noble clerk
Maister Hector Boece” (Bois or Boethius), having mentioned
“that waithman Robert Hode with his fallow litil Johne,”
adds, “of quhom ar mony fabillis and mery sportis soung
amang the vulgar pepyll.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn59" id="fnanc59">59</a> Whatever may have been the
nature of the compositions alluded to by the above writers,
several of the pieces printed in the
present collection are <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxiv">{lxxiv}</span>
unquestionably of great antiquity; not less, that is, than between
three and four hundred years old. The Lytell Geste, which
is first inserted, is probably the oldest thing upon the subject
we now possess;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn60" id="fnanc60">60</a> but a legend, apparently of the same
species, was once extant, of, perhaps, a still earlier date, of
which it is some little satisfaction to be able to give even the
following fragment, from a single leaf, fortunately preserved
in one of the volumes of old printed ballads in the British
Museum, in a handwriting as old as Henry the Sixth’s time.
It exhibits the characters of our hero and his <i>fidus Achates</i> in
the noblest point of view.</p>

<p class="pcontinue">This, indeed, may be part of the “story of
Robin Hood and Little John,” which M. Wilhelm Bedwell found in
the ancient MS. lent him by his much honoured good friend M. G.
Withers, whence he extracted and published “The Turnament of
Tottenham,” a poem of the same age, and which seemed to him to be
done (perhaps but transcribed) by Sir Gilbert Pilkington, formerly,
as some had thought, parson of that parish.<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn61" id="fnanc61">61</a></p>

<p>That poems and stories on the subject of our hero and his
companions were extraordinarily popular and common before and
during the 16th century is evident from the testimony of divers
writers. Thus, Alexander Barclay, priest, in his translation of The
Shyp of Folys, printed by Pynson in 1508, and by John Cawood in
1570,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn62" id="fnanc62">62</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>I
 write no jeste ne tale of Robin Hood.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>Again:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>For
 goodlie scripture is not worth an hawe,</div>
<div class="dpv00">But tales are loved ground of ribaudry;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And many are so blinded with their foly,</div>
<div class="dpv00">That no scriptur thinke they so true nor gode,</div>
<div class="dpv00">As is a foolish jest of Robin Hode.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>Again:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>And
 of all fables and jestes of Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Or other trifles.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxvi">{lxxvi}</span></div>

<p>The same Barclay, in the fourth of his Egloges, subjoined
to the last edition of The Ship of Foles, but originally printed
soon after 1500, has the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Yet
 would I gladly heare some mery fit</div>
<div class="dpv00">Of maide Marion, or els of Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Or Benteleyes ale, which chafeth well the blood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Of Perte of Norwich, or Sauce of Wilberton,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Or buckishe Joly<a class="afnanc" href="#fn63" id="fnanc63">63</a> well stuffed as a ton.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>Robert Braham, in his epistle to the reader, prefixed to
Lydgate’s Troy-book, 1555, is of opinion that “Caxton’s recueil”
[of Troy] is “worthye to be numbred amongest the
trifelinge tales and barrayne luerdries of Robyn Hode and
Bevys of Hampton.” (See Ames’s Typographical Antiquities,
by Herbert, p. 849.)</p>

<p>“For one that is sand blynd,” says Sir Thomas Chaloner,
“would take an asse for a moyle, or another prayse a rime
of Robyn Hode for as excellent a making as Troylus of
Chaucer, yet shoulde they not straight-waies be counted
madde therefore?” (Erasmus’s Praise of Folye, sig. h.)</p>

<p>“If good lyfe,” observes Bishop Latimer, “do not insue
and folowe upon our readinge to the example of other, we
myghte as well spende that tyme in reading of prophane
hystories, of Canterburye tales, or a fit of Roben Hode” (Sermons,
sig. A. iiii.)</p>

<p>The following lines, from a poem in the Hyndford MS.
compiled in 1568, afford an additional proof of our hero’s
popularity in Scotland:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Thair

<div class="dpv00">That me thinkes half so gude,</div>
<div class="dpv00">As of thre palmaris,” &amp;c.</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>That the subject was not forgotten in the succeeding age,
can be testifyed by Drayton, who is elsewhere quoted, and
in his sixth eclogue makes Gorbo thus address “old Winken
de Word:” <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxvii">{lxxvii}</span></p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<div class="dpv00">The morrow’s light shall lend us day enough,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And let us tell of Gawen, or Sir Guy,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Of Robin Hood, or of old Clem a Clough.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>Richard Johnson, who wrote “The History of Tom
Thumbe,” in prose (London, 1621, 12mo, b. l.), thus prefaces
his work: “My merry muse begets no tales of Guy
of Warwicke, &amp;c. nor will I trouble my penne with the
pleasant glee of Robin Hood, little John, the fryer, and his
Marian; nor will I call to mind the lusty Pinder of Wakefield,
&amp;c.”</p>

<p>In “The Calidonian Forrest,” a sort of allegorical or mystic
tale, by John Hepwith, gentleman, printed in 1641, 4to, the
author says,</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Let

prevails in the metropolis at this day. See also the word “whodes”
in Note <a href="#note34" title="go to note 34">34</a>. So, likewise, Bale, in his <i>Actes of English Votaries</i>,
1560, says, “the monkes had their cowles, caprones or whodes;” and
in Stow’s <i>Survey</i>, 1598, p. 120, have “a fooles whoode.”</p>

<p>All the entire poems and songs known to be extant will
be found in the following collection; but many more may
be traditionally preserved in different parts of the country
which would have added considerably to its
value.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn67" id="fnanc67">67</a> That <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxxii">{lxxxii}</span>
some of these identical pieces, or others of the like nature,
were great favourites with the common people in the time
of Queen Elizabeth, though not much esteemed, it would
seem, by the refined critic, may, in addition to the testimonies
already cited, be inferred from a passage
in Webbe’s Discourse <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxxiii">{lxxxiii}</span>
of English Poetrie, printed in 1586. “If I lette passe,”
says he, “the unaccountable rabble of ryming ballet-makers
and compylers of sencelesse sonets, who be most busy to
stuffe every stall full of grosse devises and unlearned pamphlets,
I trust I shall with the best sort be held excused.
For though many such can frame an alehouse-song of five
or sixe score verses, hobbling uppon some tune of a northern
jygge, or Robyn Hoode, or La lubber, &amp;c. and perhappes
observe just number of sillables, eyght in one line, sixe in
an other, and therewithall an A to make a jercke in the ende,
yet if these might be accounted poets (as it is sayde some of
them make meanes to be promoted to the lawrell), surely we
shall shortly have whole swarmes of poets; and every one
that can frame a booke in ryme, though, for want of matter,
it be but in commendations of copper noses, or bottle ale,
wyll catch at the garlande due to poets: whose potticall
(poeticall, I should say) heades, I woulde wyshe, at their
worshipfull comencements, might, in steede of lawrell, be
gorgiously garnished with fayre greene barley, in token of
their good affection to our Englishe malt.” The chief object
of this satire seems to be William Elderton,
the drunken <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxxiv">{lxxxiv}</span>
ballad-maker, of whose compositions all but one or two have
unfortunately perished.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn68" id="fnanc68">68</a></p>

<p>Most of the songs inserted in the second half of this volume
were common broad-sheet ballads, printed in black letter,
with woodcuts, between the Restoration and the Revolution;
though copies of some few have been found of an earlier
date. “Who was the author of the collection intitled Robin
Hood’s Garland, no one,” says Sir John Hawkins, “has yet
pretended to guess. As some of the songs have in them
more of the spirit of poetry than others, it is probable,” he
thinks, “it is the work of various hands: that it has from
time to time been varied and adapted to the phrase of the
times,” he says, “is certain.” None of these songs, it is believed,
were collected into a garland till after the Restoration;
as the earliest that has been met with, a copy of which is in
the possession of Francis Douce, Esq., was printed by W.
Thackeray, a noted ballad-monger, in 1670. This, however,
contains no more than sixteen songs, some of which, very
falsely as it seems, are said to have been “never before
printed.” “The latest edition of any worth,” according to
Sir John Hawkins, “is that of 1719.” None of the old editions
of this garland have any sort of preface: that prefixed
to the modern ones, of Bow or Aldermary
churchyard, being <span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxxv">{lxxxv}</span>
taken from the collection of old ballads, 1723, where it is
placed at the head of Robin Hood’s birth and breeding. The
full title of the last London edition of any note is—“Robin
Hood’s Garland: being a complete history of all the notable
and merry exploits performed by him and his men on many
occasions: To which is added a preface [<i>i.e.</i> the one already
mentioned] giving a more full and particular account of his
birth, &amp;c., than any hitherto published. [Cut of archers

by Skelton, in that most biting satire against Cardinal
Wolsey, “Why come ye not to court?” (Works, 1736, p.
147).</p>

<p>2. “Many men talk of Robin Hood that never shot in his
bow.”</p>

<p>“That is, many discourse (or prate rather) of matters
wherein they have no skill or experience. This proverb is
now extended all over England, though originally of Not­ting­ham­shire
extraction, where Robin Hood did principally
reside in Sherwood forest. He was an arch-robber, and
withal an excellent archer; though surely the poet<a class="afnanc" href="#fn71" id="fnanc71">71</a> gives a
twang to the loose of his arrow, making him shoot one a
cloth-yard long, at full forty score mark, for compass never
higher than the breast, and within less than a foot of the
mark. But herein our author hath verified the proverb,
talking at large of Robin Hood, in whose bow he never shot”
(Fuller’s Worthies, p. 315).</p>

<p>“One may justly wonder,” adds the facetious writer,
“this archer did not at last hit the mark, I mean, come to
the gallows for his many robberies.”</p>

<p>The proverb is mentioned, and given as above, by Sir
Edward Coke in his 3d Institute, p. 197. See also Note
<a href="#note26" title="go to note 26">26</a>. It is thus noticed by Jonson in “The king’s entertainment
at Welbeck in Not­ting­ham­shire, 1633:”</p>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxxviii">{lxxxviii}</span></div>

<p>On the back of a ballad in Anthony a Wood’s collection
he has written,</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Many
 talk of Robin Hood, that never shot in his bow,</div>

</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">which Kelly has varied, but without authority.</p>

<p>Camden’s printer has separated the lines, as distinct proverbs
(Remains, 1674):</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Many

<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Many

</div></div></blockquote>

<p>This proverb likewise occurs in The downfall of Robert
earle of Hun­ting­ton, 1600, and is alluded to in a scarce and
curious old tract intitled “The contention betwyxte Church-yeard
and Camell, upon David Dycer’s Dreame,” &amp;c. 1560,
4to, b. l.</p>

</div></div></blockquote>

<p>The Italians appear to have a similar saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p-lxxxix">{lxxxix}</span></div>

<p>3. “To overshoot Robin Hood.”</p>

<p>“And lastly and chiefly, they cry out with open mouth as
if they had overshot Robin Hood, that Plato banished them
[<i>i.e.</i> poets] out of his commonwealth” (Sir P. Sidney’s Defence
of Poesie).</p>

<p>4. “Tales of Robin Hood are good [enough] for fools.”</p>

<p>This proverb is inserted in Camden’s Remains, printed
originally in 1605; but the word in brackets is supplied from
Ray.</p>

<p>5. “To sell Robin Hood’s pennyworths.”</p>

<p>“It is spoken of things sold under half their value; or if
you will, half sold, half given. Robin Hood came lightly by
his ware, and lightly parted therewith; so that he could
afford the length of his bow for a yard of velvet. Whithersoever
he came, he carried a fair along with him; chapmen
crowding to buy his stollen commodities. But seeing the
receiver is as bad as the thief, and such buyers are as bad as
receivers, the cheap pennyworths of plundered goods may in
fine prove dear enough to their consciences” (Fuller’s Worthies,
p. 315).</p>

<p>This saying is alluded to in the old North-country song of
Randal a Barnaby:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>All
 men said, it became me well,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And Robin Hood’s pennyworths I did sell.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>6. “Come, turn about, Robin Hood.”</p>

<p>Implying that to challenge or defy our hero must have
been the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of courage. It occurs in “Wit and
Drollery,” 1661:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>O
 love, whose power and might,</div>
<div class="dpv02">No creature ere withstood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Thou forcest me to write,</div>
<div class="dpv02">Come turn about Robin-hood.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>7. “As crook’d as Robin Hood’s bow.”</p>

<p>That is, we are to conceive, when bent by himself. The
following stanza of a modern Irish song is the only authority
for this proverb that has been met with:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>The
 next with whom I did engage,</div>
<div class="dpv00">It was an old woman worn with age, <span class="xxpn" id="p-xc">{xc}</span></div>
<div class="dpv00">Her teeth were like tobacco pegs,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Besides she had two bandy legs,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Her back more crook’d than Robin Hood’s bow,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Purblind and decrepid, unable to go;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Altho’ her years were sixty-three,</div>
<div class="dpv00">She smil’d at the humours of Soosthe Bue.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>8. “To go round by Robin Hood’s barn.”</p>

<p>This saying, which now first appears in print, is used to
imply the going of a short distance by a circuitous method,
or the farthest way about.</p>

<p id="note29">(29)&#x2005;—“<i>to
swear by him, or some of his companions, appears
to have been a usual practice.</i>”] The earliest instance of
this practice occurs in a pleasant story among “Certaine
merry tales of the mad-men of Gottam,” compiled in the
reign of Henry VIII. by Dr. Andrew Borde, an eminent
physician of that period, which here follows verbatim, as taken
from an old edition in black letter, without date (in the
Bodleian Library), being the first tale in the book.</p>

<p>“There was two men of Gottam, and the one of them was
going to the market at Nottingham to buy sheepe, and the
other came from the market; and both met together upon
Nottingham bridge. Well met, said the one to the other.
Whither be yee going? said he that came from Nottingham.
Marry, said he that was going thither, I goe to the market to
buy sheepe. Buy sheepe! said the other, and which way
wilt thou bring them home? Marry, said the other, I will
bring them over this bridge. By Robin Hood, said he that
came from Nottingham, but thou shalt not. By Maid Marrion,
said he that was going thitherward, but I will. Thou
shalt not, said the one. I will, said the other. Ter here!
said the one. Shue there! said the other. Then they beate
their staves against the ground, one against the other, as there
had beene an hundred sheepe betwixt them. Hold in, said
the one. Beware the leaping over the bridge of my sheepe,
said the other. I care not, said the other. They shall not
come this way, said the one. But they shall, said the other.
Then said the other, &amp; if that thou make much to doe, I will
put my finger in thy mouth. A turd thou wilt, said the other.
And as they were at that contention,
another man of Gottam <span class="xxpn" id="p-xci">{xci}</span>
came from the market, with a sacke of meale upon a horse,
and seeing and hearing his neighbours at strife for sheepe,
and none betwixt them, said, Ah fooles, will you never learn
wit? Helpe me, said he that had the meale, and lay my sack
upon my shoulder. They did so; and he went to the one
side of the bridge, and unloosed the mouth of the sacke, and
did shake out all his meale into the river. Now, neighbours,
said the man, how much meale is there in my sacke now?
Marry, there is none at all, said they. Now, by my faith,
said he, even as much wit is in your two heads, to strive for
that thing you have not. Which was the wisest of all these
three persons, judge you.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn73" id="fnanc73">73</a></p>

<p>“By the bare scalp of Robin Hood’s fat frier,” is an oath
put by Shakespeare into the mouth of one of his outlaws in
the <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, act iv. scene 1. “Robin
Hood’s fat frier” is Frier Tuck; a circumstance of which
Doctor Johnson, who set about explaining that author with a
very inadequate stock of information, was perfectly ignorant.</p>

<p id="note30">(30)&#x2005;—“<i>his
songs have been preferred, not only on the most
solemn occasion to the psalms of David, but in fact to the
New Testament.</i>”] [“On Friday, March 9th, 1733] was
executed at Northampton William Alcock for the murder of
his wife. He never own’d the fact, nor was at all concern’d
at his approaching death, refusing the prayers and assistance
of any persons. In the morning he drank more than was
sufficient, yet sent and paid for a pint of wine, which being
deny’d him, he would not enter the cart before he had his
money return’d. On his way to the gallows he sung part of
an old song of Robin Hood, with the chorus, Derry, derry,
down,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn74" id="fnanc74">74</a> &amp;c., and swore, kick’d and spurn’d at
every person <span class="xxpn" id="p-xcii">{xcii}</span>
that laid hold of the cart; and before he was turn’d off, took
off his shoes, to avoid a well-known proverb; and being told
by a person in the cart with him, it was more proper for him
to read, or hear some body read to him, than so vilely to swear
and sing, he struck the book out of the person’s hands, and
went on damning the spectators, and calling for wine. Whilst
psalms and prayers were performing at the tree, he did little
but talk to one or other, desiring some to remember him, others
to drink to his good journey; and to the last moment declared
the injustice of his case” (Gentleman’s Magazine, vol. iii.
P. 154).</p>

<p>To this maybe added, that at Edinburgh, in 1565, “Sandy
Stevin menstrall [<i>i.e.</i> musician] was convinced of blasphemy,
alledging, That he would give no moir credit to The new
testament, then to a tale of Robin Hood, except it wer confirmed
be the doctours of the church” (Knox’s Historie of
the Reformation in Scotland, Edin. 1732, p. 368).</p>

<p>William Roy, in a bitter satire against Cardinal Wolsey,
intitled, “Rede me and be nott wrothe For I saye nothynge
but trothe,” printed abroad, about 1525, speaking of the
bishops, says:</p>

<blockquote>

</div></div></blockquote>

<p>To the same effect is the following passage in another old
libel upon the priests, intitled “I playne Piers which can not
flatter, a plowe-man men me call,” &amp;c. b. l. n. d. printed in
the original as prose:</p>

“<i>His service to the Word of God.</i>”] “I came once
myselfe,” says Bishop Latimer (in his sixth sermon before
King Edward VI.), “to a place, riding on a jorney homeward
from London, and I sent worde over night into the towne
that I would preach there in the morning, bicause it was a
holy day, and methought it was an holydayes worke. The
churche stode in my way; and I tooke my horse and my
company and went thither (I thought I should have found a
great companye in the churche), and when I came there, the
churche dore was faste locked. I taried there half an hower
and more; at last the keye was founde; and one of the
parishe commes to me, and sayes, Sir, this is a busie day
with us, we cannot heare you; it is Robin Hoodes daye.
The parishe are gone abroad to gather for Robin Hoode, I
pray you let them not. I was fayne there to geve place to
Robin Hoode. I thought my rochet shoulde have bene regarded,
thoughe I were not; but it woulde not serve, it was
fayne to geve place to Robin Hodes men. <span class="xxpn" id="p-xciv">{xciv}</span></p>

<p id="note32">(32)&#x2005;—“<i>may
be called the patron of archery.</i>”] The bow
and arrow makers, in particular, have always held his memory
in the utmost reverence. Thus, in the old ballad of London’s
Ordinary:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>The

 class="afnanc" href="#fn77" id="fnanc77">77</a></div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>The picture of our hero is yet a common sign in the country,
and, before hanging-signs were abolished in London, must
have been still more so in the City; there being at present
no less than a dozen alleys, courts, lanes, &amp;c., to which he or
it has given a name. (See Baldwin’s New Complete Guide,
1770.) The Robin Hood Society, a club or assembly for
public debate, or school for oratory, is well known. It was
held at a public-house, which had once borne the sign, and
still retained the name of this great man, in Butcher Row,
near Temple Bar.</p>

<p>It is very usual in the North of England for a publican
whose name fortunately happens to be John
Little to have <span class="xxpn" id="p-xcv">{xcv}</span>
the sign of Robin Hood and his constant attendant, with this
quibbling subscription:</p>

viz.:</p>

<p id="note33">(33)&#x2005;—“<i>the
supernatural powers he is, in some parts,
supposed to have possessed.</i>”] “In the parish of Halifax is an
immense stone or rock, supposed to be a Druidical monument,
there called Robin Hood’s pennystone, which he is said to
have used to pitch with at a mark for his amusement.
There is likewise another of these stones, of several tons
weight, which the country-people will tell you he threw off
an adjoining hill with a spade as he was digging. Every
thing of the marvellous kind being here attributed to Robin
Hood, as it is in Cornwall to King Arthur” (Watson’s History
of Halifax, p. 27).</p>

<p>At Birchover, six miles south of Bakewell, and four from
Haddon, in Derbyshire, among several singular groups of
rocks, are some stones called Robin Hood’s
stride, being two <span class="xxpn" id="p-xcvi">{xcvi}</span>
of the highest and most remarkable. The people say Robin
Hood lived here.</p>

<p id="note34">(34)&#x2005;—“<i>having
a festival allotted to him, and solemn games
instituted in honour of his memory</i>,” <i>&amp;c.</i>] These games,
which were of great antiquity and different kinds, appear to
have been solemnised on the first and succeeding days of May,
and to owe their original establishment to the cultivation and
improvement of the manly exercise of archery, which was
not, in former times, practised merely for the sake of amusement.</p>

<p>“I find,” says Stow, “that in the moneth of May, the
citizens of London, of all estates, lightlie in every parish, or
sometimes two or three parishes joyning together, had their
severall mayinges, and did fetch in Maypoles, with divers
warlike shewes, with good archers, morrice-dancers, and other
devices for pastime all the day long: and towards the evening
they had stage-playes and bonefires in the streetes. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
These greate Mayinges and Maygames, made by the governors
and masters of this citie, with the triumphant setting up
of the greate shafte (a principall Maypole in Cornhill, before
the parish church of S. Andrew, therefore called Undershafte)
by meane of an insurrection of youthes against alianes on
Mayday 1517, the ninth of Henry the Eight, have not beene
so freely used as afore” (Survey of London, 1598, p. 72).</p>

<p>The disuse of these ancient pastimes, and the consequent
“neglect of archerie,” are thus pathetically lamented by
Richard Niccolls, in his London’s Artillery, 1616:</p>

<p class="pcontinue">may be reasonably supposed to allude to Henry VIII., who
appears to have been particularly attached, as well to the
exercise of archery as to the observance of May. Some
short time after his coronation, says Hall, he “came to
Westminster with the quene, and all their traine: and on a
tyme being there, his grace therles of Essex, Wilshire, and
other noble menne, to the numbre of twelve, came sodainly
in a mornyng into the quenes chambre, all appareled in
short cotes of Kentish Kendal, with hodes on their heddes,
and hosen of the same, every one of them his bowe and
arrowes, and a sworde and a bucklar, like outlawes, or
‘Robyn’ Hodes men; whereof the quene, the ladies, and al
other there were abashed, aswell for the straunge sight, as
also for their sodain commyng: and after certayn daunces
and pastime made thei departed” (Hen. VIII. fo. 6, b).
The same author gives the following curious account of “A
maiynge” in the 7th year of this monarch (1516): “The
kyng &amp; the quene, accompanied with many lordes &amp; ladies,
roade to the high grounde on Shoters hil to take the open
ayre, and as they passed by the way they espied a company
of tall yomen, clothed all in grene, with grene whodes &amp;
bowes and arrowes, to the number of ii. C. Then one of
them whiche called hymselfe Robyn Hood, came to the
kyng, desyring hym to se his men shote, &amp; the kyng was
content. Then he whisteled, and all the ii. C. archers shot
&amp; losed at once; and then he whisteled again, and they
likewyse shot agayne; their arrowes
whisteled by craft of the <span class="xxpn" id="p-xcviii">{xcviii}</span>
head, so that the noyes was straunge and great, and muche
pleased the kyng, the quene, and all the company. All
these archers were of the kynges garde, and had thus appareled
themselves to make solace to the kynge. Then Robyn
Hood desyred the kyng and quene to come into the grene
wood, and to se how the outlawes lyve. The kyng demaunded
of the quene and her ladyes, if they durst adventure
to go into the wood with so many outlawes. Then the
quene said, if it pleased hym, she was content. Then the
hornes blewe tyll they came to the wood under Shoters-hill,
and there was an arber made of bowes, with a hal, and a
great chamber, and an inner chamber, very well made and
covered with floures and swete herbes, which the kyng muche
praised. Then sayd Robyn Hood, Sir, outlawes brekefastes
is venyson, and therefore you must be content with such fare
as we use. Then the kyng and quene sate doune, and were
served with venyson and vyne by Robyn Hood and his men,
to their great contentacion. Then the kyng departed and
his company, and Robyn Hood and his men them conduicted:
and as they were returnyng, there met with them
two ladyes in a ryche chariot drawen with v. horses, and every
horse had his name on his head, and on every horse sat a
lady with her name written .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and in the chayre sate the
lady May, accompanied with lady Flora, richely appareled;
and they saluted the kyng with diverse goodly songes, and so
brought hym to Grenewyche. At this maiyng was a greate
number of people to beholde, to their great solace and
confort” (fo. lvi. b).</p>

<p>That this sort of May-games was not peculiar to London
appears from a passage in Richard Robinson’s “Third assertion
Englishe historicall, frendly in favour and furtherance
of English archery:”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn80" id="fnanc80">80</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p-xcix">{xcix}</span></p>

<blockquote>

</div></div></blockquote>

<p>The games of Robin Hood seem to have been occasionally of a
dramatic cast. Sir John Paston, in the time of King Edward IV.,
complaining of the ingratitude of his servants, mentions one who
had promised never to desert him, “and ther uppon,” says he,
“I have kepyd hym thys iii yer to pleye seynt Jorge, and Robyn
Hod and the sheryf off Notyngham,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn81"
id="fnanc81">81</a> and now when I wolde have good horse he is goon
into Bernysdale, and I withowt a keeper.”</p>

<p>In some old accounts of the churchwardens of St. Helen’s
at Abingdon, Berks, for the year 1556, there is an entry For
setting up Robin Hoodes Bower; I suppose, says <span class="xxpn"
id="p-c">{c}</span> Warton, for a parish interlude. (See History
of English Poetry, ii. 175.)<a class="afnanc" href="#fn82"
id="fnanc82">82</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p-ci">{ci}</span></p>

<p>In some places, at least, these games were nothing more, in
effect, than a morris-dance, in which Robin Hood, Little John, Maid
Marian, and Frier Tuck were the principal personages; the others
being a clown or fool, the hobby-horse (which appears, for some
reason or other, to have been frequently forgot<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn83" id="fnanc83">83</a>), the taborer, and the dancers,
who were more or less numerous. Thus Warner:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>At
 Paske began our morrise, and ere penticost our May,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Tho Roben Hood, liell John, frier Tuck, and Marian deftly play,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And lard and ladie gang till kirke with
 lads and lasses gay.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn84"
 id="fnanc84">84</a></div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the clearest idea of these last-mentioned games,
about the beginning of the 16th century, will be derived
from some curious extracts given by Mr. Lysons in his valuable
work intitled “The Environs of London” (vol. i. 1792,
p. 226), from the contemporary accounts of the “churchwardens
of the parish of Kingston upon Thames.”</p></div><!--section-->

a parochial undertaking at least, after the above period, as the
industrious inquirer found no further entries relating to them.</p>

<p>Some of the principal characters of the morris seem to have
gradually disappeared, so that at length it consisted only of the
dancers, the piper, and the fool. In Mr. Tollet’s window we find
neither Robin Hood nor Little John, though Marian and the frier
are still distinguished performers.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn95"

<p class="dclearfix">It is therefore highly probable, as hath
been already suggested, that the <i>May-game of Robin Hood</i> and the
<i>morris-dance</i> had originally no sort of connection; that the
performers had united their forces, because their joint efforts
proved more successful, lucrative, or agreeable; and that, in fine,
the latter gradually shook off companions from whose association
they no longer derived any advantage.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn99"

Abuses, 1583) contains a singular description of a grand
parochial morris-dance, which is worthy of perusal.</p>

<p>It is observable that, in the sham second part of <i>Hudibras</i>,
published 1663, this place is said to be</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Highly
 famed for <i>Hocktide games</i>.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">(Grey’s edition of <i>Hudibras</i>, ii. 90.) Of what nature these
were (at Kingston) we are not informed. See Plot’s Natural
History of Oxfordshire; Leland’s Collectanea, v. Roas.</p>

<p><i>Hocktide</i> or <i>Hock-day</i> was the Tuesday fortnight after
Easter. Two falsehoods are asserted of this festival: one,
that its celebration was owing to the general joy excited by
the death of Hardecnute, which in fact took place on the
8th of June: the other, that it was the anniversary of the
general slaughter of the Danes in 1042; which Henry of
Huntingdon and others expressly fix on St. Brice’s day, being
the 13th of November.</p>

<p>It plainly appears, by these extracts, that <i>Robyn Hode</i>,
<i>Little John</i>, <i>the frere</i>, and <i>mayde Maryan</i> were fitted out at
the same time with <i>the mores daunsars</i>, and, consequently,
it would seem, united with them in one and the same exhibition.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn100" id="fnanc100">100</a></p>

<p>“Also it was said, that the ladie hir selfe, the same daie
hir husband and she should be crowned, said that she feared
they should prove but as a summer king and queene, such as
in countrie townes the yoong folks choose for short to danse
about maipoles” (Holinshed, at the year 1306).</p>

<p>As to the original institution of May-poles, or king and
queen of May,—in a word, of the primitive purpose and
celebration of a popular festival at that
season,—nothing <span class="xxpn" id="p-cviii">{cviii}</span>
satisfactory or consequential can be discovered. The curious
reader, at the same time, may consult Spelman’s Glossary,

<p>In an old manuscript music-book given lately by Mr.
Dalziel to the Advocates’ Library are the following scraps of
songs about Robin Hood:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>First
 when Robin good bow bare,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Was never bairne so bold,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>The
 nock is out of Johnes bow, Joly, joly,” &amp;c.</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>Much curious matter on the subject of the morris-dance is
to be found in “Mr. Tollet’s opinion concerning the Morris-dancers
upon his Window.” (See Steevens’s Shakespeare, v.
425, edition 1778, or viii. 596, edition 1793. See also
Mr. Waldron’s notes upon the Sad Shepherd, 1783, p. 255.)
Morris-dancers are said to be yet annually seen in Norfolk,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn101" id="fnanc101">101</a>
and make their constant appearance in Lancashire.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn102" id="fnanc102">102</a></p>

<p>In Scotland, “The game of Robin Hood was celebrated
in the month of May. The populace assembled
previous to <span class="xxpn" id="p-cvix">{cvix}</span>
the celebration of this festival, and chose some respectable<a class="afnanc" href="#fn103" id="fnanc103">103</a>
member of the corporation to officiate in the character of
Robin Hood, and another in that of Little John his squire.
Upon the day appointed, which was a Sunday or holyday,
the people assembled in military array, and went to some adjoining
field, where, either as actors or spectators, the whole
inhabitants of the respective towns were convened. In this
field they probably amused themselves with a representation
of Robin Hood’s predatory exploits, or of his encounters with
the officers of justice [rather, perhaps, in feats of archery or
military exercises].</p>

<p>“As numerous meetings for disorderly mirth are apt to
engender tumult, when the minds of the people came to
be agitated with religious controversy, it was found necessary
to repress the game<a class="afnanc" href="#fn104" id="fnanc104">104</a> of Robin Hood by public statute.
The populace were by no means willing to relinquish their
favourite amusement. Year after year the magistrates of
Edinburgh were obliged to exert their authority<a class="afnanc" href="#fn105" id="fnanc105">105</a> in repressing
this game; often ineffectually. In the year 1561, the
mob were so enraged at being disappointed in making a
Robin Hood, that they rose in mutiny, seized on the city
gates, committed robberies upon strangers;
and one of the <span class="xxpn" id="p-cx">{cx}</span>
ringleaders being condemned by the magistrates to be hanged,
the mob forced open the jail, set at liberty the criminal and
all the prisoners, and broke in pieces the gibbet erected at
the cross for executing the malefactor. They next assaulted
the magistrates, who were<a class="afnanc" href="#fn106" id="fnanc106">106</a> sitting in the council-chamber,
and who fled to the Tolbooth for shelter, where the mob
attacked them, battering the doors, and pouring stones through
the windows. Application was made to the deacons of the
corporations to appease the tumult. Remaining, however,
unconcerned spectators, they made this answer: ‘They will
be magistrates alone; let them rule the people alone.’ The
magistrates were kept in confinement till they made proclamation
be published, offering indemnity to the rioters upon
laying down their arms. Still, however, so late as the year
1592, we find the General Assembly complaining of the profanation
of the sabbath, by making<a class="afnanc" href="#fn107" id="fnanc107">107</a> of Robin Hood plays”
(Arnot’s History of Edinburgh, p. 77).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the above representation, it is certain that
these amusements were considerably upon the decline before
the year 1568. This appears from a poem by Alexander
Scot, preserved in the Hyndford MS. (in the Advocates’
Library, compiled and written in that identical year), and
inaccurately printed in The Evergreen:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<div class="dpv00">But gif it be amangis clovin Robbynis.”</div>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p id="note35">(35)&#x2005;—“<i>His
bow, and one of his arrows, his chair, his
cap, and one of his slippers were preserved till within the
present century.</i>”] “We omitted,” says Ray, “the sight of
Fountain’s Abbey, where Robin Hood’s bow is kept” (Itineraries,
1760, p. 161).</p>

<p>“Having pleased ourselves with the antiquities of ‘Notingham,’
we took horse and went to visit
the well and <span class="xxpn" id="p-cxi">{cxi}</span>
ancient chair of Robin Hood, which is not far from hence,
within the forest of Sherwood. Being placed in the chair,
we had a cap, which they say was his, very formally put
upon our heads, and having performed the usual ceremonies
befitting so great a solemnity, we receiv’d the freedom of the
chair, and were incorporated into the society of that renowned
brotherhood” (Brome’s Travels over England, &amp;c.,
1700, p. 85).</p>

<p>“On one side of this forest [sci. of Sherwood] towards
Nottingham,” says the author of “The Travels of Tom Thumb
over England and Wales” (<i>i.e.</i> Robert Dodsley), “I was
shewn a chair, a bow, and arrow, all said to have been his
[Robin Hood’s] property” (p. 82).</p>

<p>“I was pleased with a slipper, belonging to the famous
Robin Hood, shewn me, fifty years ago, at St. Ann’s well,
near Nottingham, a place upon the borders of Sherwood
forest, to which he resorted” (Journey from Birmingham to
London, by W. Hutton, Bir. 1785, p. 174).</p>

<p id="note36">(36)&#x2005;—“<i>Not
only places which afforded him security or
amusement, but even the well at which he quenched his
thirst, still retain his name.</i>”] Robin Hood’s Bay is both a
bay and a village on the coast of Yorkshire, between Whitby
and Scarborough. It is mentioned by Leland as “a fischer
tounlet of 20. bootes caullid Robyn Huddes bay, a dok or
bosom of a mile yn length” (Itinerary, i. 53). “When his
robberies,” says Master Charlton, “became so numerous,
and the outcries against him so loud, as almost to alarm the
whole nation, parties of soldiers were sent down from London
to apprehend him: and then it was, that fearing for his
safety, he found it necessary to desert his usual haunts, and,
retreating northward, to cross the moors that surrounded
Whitby [one side whereof happens, a little unfortunately,
to lie open to the sea], where, gaining the sea-coast, he
always had in readiness near at hand some small fishing
vessels, to which he could have refuge, if he found himself
pursued; for in these, putting off to sea, he looked upon
himself as quite secure, and held the whole power of the
English nation at defiance. The chief
place of his resort <span class="xxpn" id="p-cxii">{cxii}</span>
at these times, where his boats were generally laid up, was
about six miles from Whitby, to which he communicated
his name, and which is still called Robin Hood’s Bay. There
he frequently went a fishing in the summer season, even
when no enemy appeared to annoy him, and not far from
that place he had buts or marks set up, where he used to
exercise his men in shooting with the long-bow.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn108" id="fnanc108">108</a></p>

<p>Near Gloucester is “a famous hill” called “Robin Hood’s
hill,” concerning which there is a very foolish modern song.
Another hill of the same name exists in the neighbourhood
of Castleton, Derbyshire.</p>

<p>“Over a spring call’d Robin Hoods well (3 or 4 miles [on] this
side [<i>i.e.</i> north] of Doncaster, and but a quarter of a mile only
from 2 towns call’d Skelbrough and Bourmallis) is a very handsome
stone arch, erected by the Lord Carlisle, where passengers from the
coach frequently drink of the fair water, and give their charity to
two people who attend there” (Gent’s History of York. York, 1730,
p. 234).<a class="afnanc" href="#fn109" id="fnanc109">109</a> <span
class="xxpn" id="p-cxiii">{cxiii}</span></p>

<p>Though there is no attendance at present, nor is the water
altogether so fair as it might and should be, the case was
otherwise in the days of honest Barnaby.</p>

<p id="note37">(37)&#x2005;—“<i>conferred
as a singular distinction upon the prime
minister to the king of Madagascar.</i>”] The natives of this
island, who have dealings with our people, pride themselves,
it seems, in English names, which are bestowed upon them at
the discretion or caprice of the sailors: and thus a venerable
minister of state, who should have been called Sir Robert
Walpole or Cardinal Fleury, acquired the name of Robin
Hood. Mr. Ives, by whom he is frequently mentioned, relates
the following <span class="nowrap">anecdote:—</span></p>

<p>“The reader will excuse my giving him another instance
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which still more strikingly displays the extreme sensibility
of these islanders, in respect to their king’s dignity.
Robin Hood (who seemed to act as prime minister, and negotiate
most of the king’s concerns with our agent-victualler)
was one day transacting business with another gentleman of
the squadron, and they happened to differ so much about the
value of a certain commodity, that high words arose, and at
length Robin Hood in the greatest agitation started from the
ground where he was sitting, and swore that he would immediately
acquaint the king of Baba with what had passed.
Our English gentleman, too much heated with this threat, and
the violent altercation which had preceded it, unguardedly
replied, ‘D―n the king of Baba.’ The eyes of Robin
Hood flashed like lightning, and in the most violent wrath he
retorted, ‘D―n King George.’ At the same instant he left
the spot, hurrying away towards the Madagascarian cottages.
Our countryman was soon struck with the impropriety of his
behaviour, followed and overtook the disputant,
and having <span class="xxpn" id="p-cxv">{cxv}</span>
made all proper concessions, the affair was happily terminated.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn112" id="fnanc112">112</a></p>

<p id="note38">(38)
“<i>After his death his company was dispersed.</i>”] They
and their successors, disciples, or followers are supposed to
have been afterward distinguished, from the name of their
gallant leader, by the title of Roberdsmen. Lord Coke, who
is somewhat singular in accusing him of living “by robbery,
burning of houses, felony, waste and spoil, and principally by
and with vagabonds, idle wanderers, night-walkers, and draw-latches,”
says that “albeit he lived in Yorkshire, yet men of
his quality took their denomination of him, and were called
Roberdsmen throughout all England. Against these men,”
continues he, “was the statute of Winchester made in 13 E.
1. [c. 14], for preventing of robbery, murders, burning of
houses, &amp;c. Also the statute of 5 E. 3. [c. 14], which ‘recites’
the statute of Winchester, and that there had been
divers manslaughters, felonies, and robberies done in times
past, by people that be called Roberdsmen, wasters and draw-latches;
and remedy [is] provided by that act for the arresting
of them. At the parliament holden 50 E. 3.,” he adds,
“it was petitioned to the king that ribauds and sturdy beggars
might be banished out of every town. The answer of
the king in parliament was, touching ribauds: The statute of
Winchester and the declaration of the same with other statutes
of Roberdsmen, and for such as make themselves gentlemen,
and men of armes, and archers, if they cannot so prove theirselves,
let them be driven to their occupation or service, or to
the place from whence they came.” He likewise notices the
statute of 7 R. 2. [c. 5], by which it is provided “that the
statutes of Roberdsmen and draw-latches be firmly holden
and kept” (3 Inst. 197).</p>

<p>These Roberdsmen are mentioned in Pierce the Ploughman’s
Crede, written about 1400:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>And
 right as Robartesmen raken aboute.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc"

</div></div></blockquote>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p-cxvi">{cxvi}</span></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Mr. Warton, who had once thought that the friers Robertines
were here meant, observes that “the expression of Robin
Hoode’s men, in Bishop Latimer’s sermon, is not without an
allusion to the bad sense of Roberdsmen” (H. E. P. ii.
additions, sig. d. 4). It does not, however, appear that the
latter word has been ever used in a good one; nor is there,
after all, sufficient ground for concluding that these people
were so named after Robin Hood.</p>

<p id="note39">(39)&#x2005;—“<i>the
honour of Little John’s death and burial is
contended for by rival nations.</i>”] I. By England.—At the village
of Hathersage, about six miles from Castleton, in Derbyshire, is
Little John’s grave. A few years ago some curious person caused it
to be opened, when there were found several bones of an uncommon
size, which he preserved; but, meeting afterwards with many unlucky
accidents, he carefully replaced them; partly at the intercession
of the sexton, who had taken them up for him, and who had in like
manner been visited with misfortunes: upon restoring the bones
all these troubles ceased. Such is the tradition at Castleton. E.
Hargrove, in his “Anecdotes of Archery,” York, 1792, asserts that
“the grave is distinguished by a large stone placed at the head,
and another at the feet, on each of which are yet some remains
of the letters I. L.” (p. 26).<a class="afnanc" href="#fn114"
id="fnanc114">114</a> II. By Scotland.—“In Murray land,” according
to that most veracious historian Maister Hector Bois, “is the
kirke of Pette, quhare the banis of lytill Johne remanis in
gret admiratioun of pepill. He hes bene fourtene fut of hycht<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn115" id="fnanc115">115</a> with square

were effeminat with lust and intemperance of mouth.”&#x202f;<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn116" id="fnanc116">116</a> III. By
Ireland.—“There standeth,” as Stanihurst relates, “in Ostmantowne
greene an hillocke, named little John his shot. The occasion,” he
says, “proceeded of this.</p>

<p>“In the yeare one thousand one hundred foure score and
nine, there ranged three robbers and outlaws in England,
among which Robert Hood and Little John weere cheefeteins,
of all theeves doubtlesse the most courteous. Robert Hood
being betrayed at a nunrie in Scotland called Bricklies, the
remnant of the crue was scattered, and everie man forced to
shift for himselfe. Whereupon Little John was faine to flee
the realme by sailing into Ireland, where he sojornied for a
few daies at Dublin. The citizens being doone to understand
the wandering outcast to be an excellent archer, requested
him hartilie to trie how far he could shoot at random; who
yeelding to their behest, stood on the bridge of Dublin, and
shot to that mole hill, leaving behind him a monument,
rather by his posteritie to be woondered, than possiblie by
anie man living to be counterscored. But as the repaire of
so notorious a champion to anie countrie would soone be
published, so his abode could not be long concealed: and
therefore to eschew the danger of [the] lawes, he fled into
Scotland, where he died at a towne or village called Moravie.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn117" id="fnanc117">117</a>
Thus Stanihurst, who is quoted by Dr. Hanmer in
his Chronicle of Ireland, p. 179, but Mr. Walker, after observing
that “poor Little John’s great practical skill in archery
could not save him from an ignominious fate,” says, “it
appeared, from some records in the
Southwell family, that <span class="xxpn" id="p-cxviii">{cxviii}</span>
he was publicly executed for robbery on Arbor Hill,
Dublin.”&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn118" id="fnanc118">118</a></p>

<p id="note40">(40)&#x2005;—“<i>some

<i>&amp;c.</i>] See the preface to the History of George a Green.
As surnames were by no means in general use at the close of
the twelfth century, Little John may have obtained that of
Nailor from his original profession.</p>

Stukeley’s Palæographia Britannica, No. II.
p. 115. In an interleaved copy of Robin Hood’s Garland
formerly belonging to Dr. Stukeley, and now in the possession
of Francis Douce, esquire, opposite the second page of the
first song, is the following note in his own hand:</p>

<div id="notep-xxii">
<img src="images/i-xxii.png" width="800" height="461"
alt="pedigree, see transcriber's note." /></div>

<p>The Doctor seems, by this pedigree, to have founded our hero’s pretensions
on his descent from Roisia, sister of Robert Fitzgilbert, husband
of Alice, youngest daughter of Judith, Countess of Huntingdon, which,
whatever it might do in those times, would scarcely be thought sufficient
to support such a claim at present. Beside, though John the Scot died
without issue, he left three sisters, all married to powerful barons, either
in Scotland or in England, none of whom, however, assumed the title.
It is, therefore, probable, after all, that Robin Hood derived his earldom
by some other channel.</p>

<p>Dr. Stukeley, whose learned labours are sufficiently known and
esteemed, was a professed antiquary, and a beneficed clergyman of the
Church of England. He has not, it is true, thought it necessary to cite
any ancient or other authority in support of the above representations;
nor is it in the editor’s power to supply the deficiency. Perhaps, indeed,
the Doctor might think himself entitled to expect that his own authority
would be deemed sufficient: upon that, however, they must be content
to rest. <i>Sit fides penes auctorem!</i> Mr. Parkin, who published “A reply
to the peevish, weak, and malevolent objections brought by Dr. Stukeley
in his Origines Roystonianæ, No. 2” (Norwich, 1748, 4to), terms
“his pedigree of Robin Hood, quite jocose, an original indeed!” (See
pp. 27, 32.)</p>

<p>Otho and Fitz-Otho, it must be confessed, were common names among
the Anglo-Normans,&#x002a; but no such name as Othes, Ooth, Fitz-Othes, or
Fitz-Ooth, has been elsewhere met with. Philip de Kime, also, was
certainly a considerable landholder in the county of Lincoln in the time
of King Henry II., but it nowhere appears, except from Dr. Stukeley,
that his surname was Fitz-Ooth.</p>

<p>The Doctor likewise informs us that the arms of Ralph Fitz-Ooth, and
consequently of our hero, were “g. two bendlets engrailed, o.”</p>

Plompton Park, upon the banks of the Peterill,
in Cumberland, was formerly very large, and set apart
by the kings of England for the keeping of deer. It was
disafforested or disparked by Henry VIII. See Camden’s
Britannia, by Bishop Gibson, who seems to confound this park
with Inglewood forest, a district of sixteen miles in length,
reaching from Carlisle to Penrith, where the kings of England
used to hunt, and Edward I. is reported to have killed 200
bucks in one day (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p></div>

Surely the “lady” alluded to in the old May-game
cannot be our Maid Marian. The earliest notice of her occurs
in Barclay’s <i>Egloges</i>, about 1500, where she is evidently
connected with Robin Hood. See Note

Without “the ancient songs,” to which the Doctor
refers, are confined to his “old MS.,” he evidently asserts
what he would probably find it difficult to prove. As for the
passage he produces, it seems nothing to the purpose; as, in
the first place, it is apparently not “antient,” and, in the
second, it is apparently not from a “song of Robin Hood.”</p></div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst">&#x2007;<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc23" id="fn23">23</a>
Mr. Warton, having observed that “The play
of Robin and Marian is said to have been performed by the
school-boys of Angiers, according to annual custom, in the
year 1392: The boys were deguisiez, says the old French
record; and they had among them un fillette desguisee
(Carpent. Du Cange, v. Robinet-Pentecoste),” adds, “Our old
character of Mayd Marian may be hence illustrated” (His. En.
po. i. 245). This, indeed, seems sufficiently plausible;
but unfortunately the Robin and Marian of Angiers are not
the Robin and Marian of Sherwood. The play is still extant.
See Fabliaux ou Contes, Paris, 1781, ii. 144. There are,
likewise, some very ancient pastoral ballads on the subject
of these two lovers. See La Borde, <i>Essai sur la Musique</i>,
ii. 163, 215. But, in fact, the names of <i>Robin</i> and <i>Marion</i>
seem to have been used by the <i>chansonniers</i> of antiquity
like those of <i>Colin</i> and <i>Phœbe</i>, &amp;c.</p></div>

“The quarry from whence King Wolfere fetched
stones for his royal structure [<i>i.e.</i> Peterborough] was
undoubtedly that of Bernach near unto Stamford .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And I find
in the charter of K. Edward the Confessor,
which he granted to the abbot of Ramsey, that the abbot of Ramsey
should give to the abbot and convent of Peterburgh 4000 eeles in the
time of Lent, and in consideration thereof the abbot of Peterburgh should
give to the abbot of Ramsey as much freestone from his pitts in Bernack,
and as much ragstone from his pitts in Peterburgh as he should need.
Nor did the abbot of Peterburgh from these pits furnish only that but
other abbies also, as that of St. Edmunds-Bury: in memory whereof
there are two long stones yet standing upon a balk in Castor-field, near
unto Gunwade-ferry; which erroneous tradition hath given out to be
draughts of arrows from Alwalton churchyard thither; the one of Robin
Hood, and the other of Little John; but the truth is, they were set up
for witnesses, that the carriages of stone from Bernack to Gunwade-ferry,
to be conveyed to S. Edmunds-Bury, might pass that way without paying
toll; and in some old terrars they are called S. Edmund’s stones. These
stones are nicked in their tops after the manner of arrows, probably
enough in memory of S. Edmund, who was shot to death with arrows by
the Danes” (Gunton’s History of the Church of Peterburgh, 1686, p. 4).</p></div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst">&#x2007;<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc26" id="fn26">26</a>
“In this relation,” Mr. Walker observes, “the Doctor not only
evinces his credulity, but displays his ignorance of archery; for the ingenious
and learned Mr. Barrington, than whom no man can be better
informed on the subject, thinks that eleven score and seven yards is the
utmost extent that an arrow can be shot from a long bow” (Archæologia,
vol. viii.) According to tradition, he adds, Little John shot an
arrow from the Old-bridge, Dublin, to the present site of St. Michael’s
church, a distance not exceeding, he believes, that mentioned by Mr.
Barrington (Historical Essay on the Dress of the Ancient and Modern
Irish, p. 129).</p>

<p>What Mr. Barrington “thinks” may be true enough, perhaps, of the
Toxophilite Society and other modern archers; but people should not
talk of Robin Hood who never shot in his bow. The above ingenious
writer’s censure of Dr. Hanmer’s credulity and ignorance, seems to be
misapplied, since he cannot be supposed to believe what he holds not
for truth, and actually leaves among the lyes of the land.</p>

<p>See also the old song, printed in the Appendix, No. 3. Drayton, who
wrote before archery had fallen into complete disuse, <span class="nowrap">says—</span></p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“At marks full forty score they us’d to prick and rove.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>That Mr. Barrington, indeed, was very ill informed on the
subject is evident from a most scarce book in the editor’s
possession, intitled “Aime for the archers of St. George’s
fields, containing the names of all the marks in the
same fields, with their true distances according to the
dimensuration of the line. Formerly gathered by Richard
Hannis, and now corrected by Thomas Bick and others. London,
Printed by N. Howell for Robert Minehard and Benjamin
Brownsmith, and are to be sold at the sign of the man in the
moon in Blackman street, 1664,” 16mo, where the distance from
<i>Alpha</i> to <i>Bick’s memorial</i> is 18 score 16 yards; and 11
score 7 yards (though there are inferior numbers, the lowest
being 9, 12) appears to be a very moderate shot indeed. Two
of these marks are <i>Robin Hood</i> and <i>Little John</i>. See also
Shakespeare’s <i>Second Part of K. Henry IV.</i>, act iii. scene
2, where it is said that <i>Old Double</i> “would have clapp’d
i’ the clout at <i>twelve score</i>; and carry’d you a forehand
shaft a <i>fourteen</i> and <i>fourteen and a half</i>;” and the notes
upon the passage in Steevens’s edition, 1793. It is probable,
after all, that the word <i>forty</i> in Drayton is an error, of
the transcriber or pressman, for <i>fourteen</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever Robin Hood’s father might do, there can be no question that
the author of the old ballad in which he is mentioned (part ii. song 1)
has “shot in a lusty strong bow” when he speaks of</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

This tradition is referred to, and the
inscription given, in Ray’s Itineraries, 1760, p. 153:—“We
rode through a bushet or common called Rodwell-hake, two
miles from Leeds, where (according to the vulgar tradition)
was once found a stag, with a ring of brass about its neck,
having this inscription:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When Julius Cæsar here was king,</div>
<div class="dpv00">About my neck he put this ring;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Whosoever doth me take,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Let me go for Cæsar’s sake.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>In The Midwife, or Old Woman’s Magazine (vol. i. p. 250),
Mrs. Midnight, in a let­ter “To the ven­er­able society of
anti­quar­ians,” containing a description of Cæsar’s camp
on Wind­sor forest, has the following passage: “There have
been many extra­or­di­nary things dis­covered about this camp.
One thing, I par­tic­u­lar­ly re­mem­ber, was a deer of about
sixteen hundred years old. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This deer it seems was
a favourite of Cæsar’s, and on that account he bedecked her
neck with a golden collar and an inscription, which I shall
by and by take notice of; she had been frequently taken,
but when the hunters, the peasants, and poor people saw the
golden collar on her neck, they readily let her go again.
However, as she continually increased in strength and in
bulk, as well as in age, after the course of about fifteen
or sixteen centuries, the flesh and skin were entirely grown
over this collar, so that it could
not be discover’d till after she was kill’d, and then to the surprise of the
virtuosi it appear’d with this inscription:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When Julius Cæsar reigned here,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then was I a little deer;</div>
<div class="dpv00">If any man should me take,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Let me go for Cæsar’s sake.</div>
</div></div>

<p>“This collar, which is of pure gold, I am told weighs thirty ounces,
and as the blood of the creature still appears fresh upon it, I believe it
may be as valuable as any of your gimcracks; however, there will be no
harm in my sending of it to you; and if I can procure it, you may depend
on my taking the utmost care of it.” As no notice is announced
of this wonderful piece of antiquity in the voluminous and important
lucubrations of the above learned body, it most probably never came
into their possession; which is very much to be lamented, as it would
have been an admirable companion for <i>Hardecnute’s chamber-pot</i>, <i>King
Edward the first’s finger</i>, and other similar curiosities.</p>

<p>Juvenal des Ursins gravely relates that in the year 1380 a hart was
taken at Senlis with a chain about his neck inscribed “<i>Cæsar hoc me
donavit</i>.”&#x002a;</p>

<p>Upton, to be even with him, supposes a hart to have been taken at
Bagshot near Windsor, with a motto on the collar in the French language,
which proves the ancient Romans were familiar therewith long before
it existed:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span><i>Julius
 Cæsar, quant jeo fus petis,</i></div>
<div class="dpv00"><i>Cest coler suz mon col ad mys.</i>”†</div>
</div></div>

<p>This <i>dictator perpetuo</i>, in fact, seems to have collared
every hart he took. The family of <i>Pompei</i> in Italy use two harts
for their supporters on whose collars were the letters N. M. T.,
in memory of one on whose collar were these words: “N<i>emo</i> M<i>e</i>
T<i>angat</i>, <i>Cæsaris sum</i>.” Anstis, ii. 113.</p>

<p>The original of all these stories is to be found in Pliny, who
says: “It is generally held and confessed that the stagge or hind
live long; for an hundred yeer after Alexander the great, some
were taken with golden collars about their necks, overgrowne now
with haire and growne within the skin: which collars the said king
had done upon them” (Naturall Historie, by Holland, 1601, B. 8,
c. 32). Pausanias, moreover, speaking of one Leocydas, who fought
for the Megalopolitans, in conjunction with Lydiades, against
the Lacedæmonians (about the year 243 before Christ), says he
was reported to be the descendant in the ninth degree of that
Arcesilaus, who living in Lycosura saw that stag which is sacred to
the goddess Despoine worn out with old age. This stag, he adds, had
a collar on its neck with the following inscription:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Caught young, when Agapenor sail’d for Troy.</div>
</div></div>

<p>By which, he concludes, it is evident that a stag lives much longer than
an elephant (B. 8, c. 10).</p>

1st edit. 1550, fo. xxvi. b. (Randolf is
misprinted Rand of.) Subsequent editions, even of the same
year, reading only “Randall of Chester.” Mr. Warton (History
of English Poetry, ii. 179) makes this genius, whom he calls
a frier, say “that he is well acquainted with the rimes of
Randall of Chester;” and these rimes he, whimsically enough,
conjectures to be the old Chester Whitsun plays; which, upon
very idle and nonsensical evidence, he supposes to have been
written by Randal Higden, the compiler of the Polychronicon.
Of course, if this absurd idea were at all well founded, the
rimes of Robin Hood must likewise allude to certain Yorkshire
or Not­ting­ham­shire plays, written by himself. The “Randolf
erl of Chester” here meant is Randal Blundevile, the last
earl of that name, who had been in the Holy Land, was a great
warrior and patriot, and died in 1231.</p>

<p>The reading of the original edition is confirmed by a very
old manuscript in the Cotton Library (Vespasian, B. XVI.)
differing considerably from the printed copies, which gives
the passage thus:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<p class="pcontinue">(See also Caligula, A. XI.)</p>

<p>In The Gentleman’s Magazine for December 1790 is the first verse of
a song used by the inhabitants of Helston in Cornwall on the celebration
of an annual festivity on the 8th of May, called the Furry-day, supposed
Flora’s day, not, it is imagined, “as many have thought, in remembrance
of some festival instituted in honour of that goddess, but rather
from the garlands commonly worn on that day.” (See the same publication
for June and October 1790.) This verse was the whole that Mr.
Urban’s correspondent could then recollect, but he thought he might be
afterwards able “to send all that is known of it, for,” he says, “it formerly
was very long, but is now much forgotten.” The stanza is as follows:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Robin
 Hood and Little John</div>
<div class="dpv00">They are both gone to fair O;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And we will go to the merry green-wood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To see what they do there O.</div>

<div class="dpv05">And rum-be-low,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And chearily we’ll get up,</div>
<div class="dpv00">As soon as any day O,</div>
<div class="dpv00">All for to bring the summer home,</div>
<div class="dpv00">The summer and the May O.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">“After which,” he adds, “there is something
about the grey goose wing; from all which,” he concludes, “the
goddess Flora has nothing to say to it.” She may have nothing to
say to the song, indeed, and yet a good deal to do with the thing.
But the fact is, that the first eight days of May, or the first day
and the eighth, seem to have been devoted by the Celtic nations to
some great religious ceremony. Certain superstitious observances
of this period still exist in the Highlands of Scotland, where it
is called the Bel-tein; Beltan, in that country, being a common
term for the beginning of May, as “between the Beltans” is a
saying significant of the first and eighth days of that month. The
games of Robin Hood, as we shall elsewhere see, were, for whatever
reason, always celebrated in May.—N.B. “Hel-an-tow,” in the above
stanza, should be heave and how. Heave and how, and Rumbelow, was
an ordinary chorus to old ballads, and is at least as ancient as
the reign of Edward II., since it occurs in the stanza of a Scotish
song, preserved by some of our old historians, on the battle of
Bannockburn.</p>

<p>To lengthen this long note: Among the Harleian MSS. (num.
367) is the fragment of “a tale of Robin Hood dialouge-wise
beetweene Watt and Jeffry. The morall is the overthrowe of
the abbyes; the like being attempted by the Puritane, which
is the wolfe, and the politician, which is the fox, agaynst
the bushops. Robin Hood, bushop; Adam Bell, abbot; Little
John, colleagues of the university.” This seems to have been
a common mode of satirising both the old Church and the
reformers. In another MS. of the same collection (N. 207),
written about 1532, is a tract entitled “The banckett of John
the reve, unto Peirs Ploughman, Laurens Laborer, Thomlyn
Tailyor, and Hobb of the Hille, with others;” being, as Mr.
Wanley says, a dispute concerning transubstantiation by a
Roman Catholic. The other, indeed, is much more modern: it
alludes to the indolence of the abbots, and their falling off
from the original purity in which they were placed by the
bishops, whom it inclines to praise. The object of its satire
seems to be the Puritans; but here it is imperfect, though
the lines preserved are not wholly destitute of poetical
merit.—“Robin Hood and the Duke of Lancaster, a ballad, to
the tune of The Abbot of Canterbury,” 1727, is a satire on
Sir Robert Walpole.</p></div>

Chatterton, in his “Memoirs of a Sad Dog,” represents “Baron
Otranto” (meaning the honourable Horace Walpole, now Earl of Orford),
when on a visit to “Sir Stentor,” as highly pleased with Robin Hood’s
ramble, “melodiously chaunted by the knight’s groom and dairy-maid, to
the excellent music of a two-stringed violin and bag-pipe,” which transported
him back “to the age of his favourite hero, Richard the Third;”
whereas, says he, “the songs of Robin Hood were not in being till the
reign of Queen Elizabeth.” This, indeed, may be in a great measure true
of those which we now have, but there is sufficient evidence of the existence
and popularity of such-like songs for ages preceding; and some of
these, no doubt, were occasionally modernised or new-written, though
most of them must be allowed to have perished.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Johnson, in controverting the authenticity of Fingal, a
composition in which the author, Mr. Macpherson, has made great use
of some unquestionably ancient Irish ballads, said, “He would undertake
to write an epick poem on the story of Robin Hood, and half England,
to whom the names and places he should mention in it are familiar, would
believe and declare they had heard it from their earliest years” (Boswell’s
Journal, p. 486).</p></div>

The following note is inserted in the fourth
edition of the Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, published
in July 1795 (vol. i. p. xcvii.):</p>

<p>“Of the 24 songs in what is now called ‘Robin Hood’s
Garland,’ many are so modern as not to be found in Pepys’s
collection, completed
only in 1700. In the [editor’s] folio MS. are ancient
fragments of the following, viz.—Robin Hood and the
beggar.—Robin Hood and the butcher.—Robin Hood and
fryer Tucke.—Robin Hood and the pindar.—Robin Hood and
queen Catharine, in two parts.—Little John and the four
beggars, and “Robine Hood his death.” This last, which is
very curious, has no resemblance to any that have yet been
published; [it is probably num. xxviii. of part ii.], and the
others are extremely different from the printed copies; but
they unfortunately are in the beginning of the MS. where half
of every leaf hath been torn away.”</p>

<p>As this MS. “contains several songs relating to the civil war
in the last century,” the mere circumstance of its comprising
fragments of the above ballads is no proof of a higher
antiquity; any more than its not containing “one that alludes
to the Restoration” proves its having been compiled before
that period; or than, because some of these 24 songs are not
to be found in Pepys’s collection, they are more modern than
1700. If the MS. could be collated, it would probably turn
out that many of its contents have been inaccurately and
unfaithfully transcribed, by some illiterate persons, from
printed copies still extant, and, consequently, that it is,
so far, of no authority. See the advertisement prefixed.</p></div>

Elizabeth’s time, “the worshipfull socyety of archers,”
instead of calling themselves after Robin Hood and his
companions, took the names of “the magnificent prince Arthure
and his knightly traine of the round

society that Master Shallow alludes in the <i>Second Part of King Henry
IV.</i> “I remember,” says he, “at Mile-end Green [their usual place of
exercise],—I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur’s shew,” &amp;c. (See also
Steevens’s Shakespeare, 1793, ix. 142.) The successors of the above

<p>In an old circular woodcut, preserved on the title of Robin Hood’s
Garland, 1670, as well as on that of Adam Bell, &amp;c., printed at Newcastle
in 1772, is the apparent representation of a May-game, consisting
of the following personages: 1. A bishop. 2. Robin Hood. 3. The
potter (or beggar). 4. Little John. 5. Frier Tuck. 6. Maid Marian.
Figures 2 and 4 are distinguished by their bows and different size. The
frier holds out a cross; and Marian has flowing hair, and wears a sort
of coronet. But the execution of the whole is too rude to merit a copy.</p>

<p>At Lord Fitzwilliams’s at Richmond there is, or lately was, a curious
painting by Vinckenbooms, representing old Richmond palace, with a
group of morris-dancers. It has been badly engraved by Godfrey, who
reduced the figures to too small a scale. Mr. Douce has a tracing from
the original picture with all the figures distinctly marked. See a poem
at the end of Hall’s Downfall of May-games, 1661, 4to.</p></div>

The precise purpose or meaning of setting up Robin Hood’s bower
has not been satisfactorily ascertained. Mr. Hearne, in an attempt to
derive the name of “The Chiltern country”
<span class="nowrap">(cil<img class="iglyph-b"
src="images/insular-t-small.png" width="29" height="60" alt="t"
/>e<img class="iglyph-b" src="images/insular-r-small.png"
width="68" height="120" alt="r" />n,</span> Saxon) from
silex, a flint, has the following words: “Certe Silcestriam, &amp;c. <i>i.e.</i>
Certainly Silchester, in Hampshire, signifies nothing but the city of
flints (that is, a city composed or built of flint-stones). And what is
more, in that very Chiltern country you may frequently see houses built
of flints, in erecting which, in ancient times, I suppose that many persons
involved themselves deeply in debt, and that, in order to extricate
themselves, they took up money at interest of I know not what great
men, which so far disturbed their minds that they would become thieves
and do many things in no wise agreeable to the English government.
Hence, the nobility ordered that large woods in the Chiltern country
should in a great measure be cut down, lest they should conceal any
considerable body of robbers, who were wont to convert the same into
lurking places. It concerns this matter to call to mind that of this sort
of robbers was that Robin or Robert Hood, of whom the vulgar dayly
sing so many wonderful things. He (being now made an outlaw)
before he retired into the north parts, frequently robbing in the Chiltern
country, lurked in the thickets thereof on purpose that he should not be
taken. Thence it was that to us boys (exhilarating, according to custom,
the mind with sports) certain countrymen, with whom we had
accidentally some conversation, shewed us that sort of den or retreat
(vulgarly called Robin Hood’s bower) in Maydenhead-thicket; which
thicket is the same that Leland in his Itinerary called Frith, by which
name the Anglo-Saxons themselves spoke of thickets. For although
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-b"
src="images/insular-f-small.png" width="24" height="60" alt="f"
/><img class="iglyph-b" src="images/insular-r-small.png" width="68"
height="120" alt="r" />ið</span>
in reality signifies peace, yet since numerous groves with them
(as well as before with the Britons) were deemed sacred, it is by no
means to be wondered at that a great wood (because manifestly an
asylum) should, in the judgment of the Anglo-Saxons, be called by no
other name than
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-b"
src="images/insular-f-small.png" width="24" height="60" alt="f"
/><img class="iglyph-b" src="images/insular-r-small.png"

and that Maydenhead-thicket was esteemed
among the greater woods Leland himself is a witness. Rightly therefore
did Robin Hood (as
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-b"
src="images/insular-f-small.png" width="24" height="60" alt="f"

reckon himself to abide there in
security” (Chronicon de Dunstaple, p. 387). What he means by all
this is, doubtless, sufficiently obscure: the mere name, however, of
Robin Hood’s bower seems a very feeble authority for concluding that
gallant outlaw to have robbed or skulked in the Chiltern hundreds.</p>

<p>It may seem, perhaps, from a passage in Browne’s <i>Britannia’s Pastorals</i>
(Song 4), that <i>Robin Hood’s bower</i> was prepared for the reception
of himself and his Marian, as king and queen of May. The lines are
these:</p>

Albion’s England, 1602, p. 121. It is part of the “Northerne man’s
speech against the friers.” He adds:</p>

<p>A very learned and ingenious gentleman conceives that the

to the <i>morrise</i>. That the two games, however, though

This quotation is misapplied. Liveries, in the present instance, are
pieces of paper or sateyn with some device thereon, which were distributed
for money among the spectators. So in a passage which will be
shortly quoted from Jack Drum’s Entertainment: “Well said, my boyes,
I must have my lord’s livory; what is’t? a May-pole?” See also Stubbs’s

“Though it varies considerably from that word,
this may be a corruption of orpiment, which was much in
use for colouring the morris garments.” How orseden can be
a corruption of orpiment is not very easy to conceive: it
may as well be supposed to mean worsted or buckram. Mr.
Steevens thinks that this <i>orseden</i> is the <i>Arse-dine</i> of
old Joan Trash, in Jonson’s Bartholomew Fair, and means
<i>flame-coloured paint</i>, used to <i>hobby-horses</i>. The four
giants for the revived Midsummer shew at Chester, in 1668,
were “to be cullered <i>tinsille arsedine</i>” (MSS. Har. 2150,

“Marian was the assumed name of the beloved mistress of Robert,
Earl of Huntingdon, whilst he was in a state of outlawry, as Robin
Hood was his. See Mr. Steevens’s note to a passage in Shakespeare’s
<i>Henry IV.</i> This character in the morris-dances was generally represented
by a boy. See Strutt’s View of Customs and Manners, vol. iii.
p. 150. It appears by one of the extracts, given above, that at Kingston
it was performed by a woman, who was paid a shilling each year
for her trouble.”</p></div>

“Mr. Steevens suggests, <i>with great probability</i>, that this word
may have the same meaning as howve or houve, used by Chaucer for
a head-dress; Maid Marian’s head-dress was always very fine: indeed
some persons have derived her name from the Italian word morione, a
head-dress.” Mr. Steevens was never less happy than he is in this very
probable conjecture. The word howve or houve, in Chaucer, is a mere
variation of hood: and Maid Marian’s head-dress must, to be sure, have
been “very fine” when made of four yards of broad cloth! A huke is a
woman’s gown or habit. (Huke, palla, toga, palium Belgicis feminis
usitatum.—<i>Skin.</i>) Skelton mentions it in his Elinour Rumming:</p>

(Itinerary, 1617, part 3, p. 169).</p>

<p>Sir John Cullum seems to have mistaken Rose Sparkes’ “best hook”
for a “hook worn at the bottom of the stays, to regulate the sitting of
the apron” (History of Hawsted, p. 25). Morione, in Italian, signifies
a murrion or scull-cap; and though the derivation alluded to appears to
have the sanction of Blount’s Glosographia, nothing can be more completely
absurd. <i>Marian</i> is <i>Mary</i>.</p>

jollity. Thus, in the celebration of St. Stephen’s day in
the Inner-Temple hall, as we find it described in Dugdale’s
Origines Juridiciales: “Supper ended, the constable-marshall
‘presenteth’ himself with drums afore him, mounted upon a
scaffold, born by four men; and goeth three times round about
the harthe, crying out aloud, A lord, a lord, &amp;c. Then he
descendeth and goeth to dance,” &amp;c. (p. 156).</p></div>

Perhaps also, Robin Hood and his party had never appeared in
company with the morris-dancers but at one particular period, in the
beginning of May, whereas we find that <i>Whitsuntide</i> was no less devoted
to the latter.</p></div>

It must be confessed that no other direct authority has been met
with for constituting <i>Robin Hood</i> and <i>Little John</i> integral characters
of the morris-dance. That <i>Maid Marian</i>, however, and the <i>Frier</i>,
were almost constantly such, is proved beyond the possibility of a doubt;
and why or how they should become so, without Robin Hood, at least,
is unaccountable.</p></div>

This county would seem to have been famous for their exertions a
couple of centuries ago. Will Kemp the player was a celebrated morris-dancer;
and in the Bodleian Library is the following scarce and curious
tract by him: “Kemp’s nine daies wonder performed in a daunce from
London to Norwich. Containing the pleasure, paines and kind entertainment
of William Kemp between London and that city in his late
morrice. Wherein is somewhat set downe worth note; to reproove the
slaunders spred of him, many things merry, nothing hurtfull. Written
by himself to satisfie his friends. London, printed by E. A. for Nicholas
Ling, 1600” 4to, b. l. On the title-page is a woodcut figure of Kemp
as a morrice-dancer, preceded by a fellow with a pipe and drum, whom
he, in the book, calls Thomas Slye his taberer.—See, in Richard Brathwayte’s
Remains after Death, 1618, some lines “upon Kempe and his
morice, with his epitaph.”</p></div>

“On Monday [July 30] the morris-dancers of Pendleton paid their

colours that a profusion of ribbons could give them, and had a very
showy garland.”—<i>Star</i>, Aug. 9, 1792.</p></div>

“Anentis Robert Hude, and abbot of Unreason. Item, It is
statute and ordained, that in all times cumming, na maner
of person be chosen Robert Hude, nor Little John, abbot of
unreason, queenis of Maij, nor utherwise, nouther in burgh,

unreason is the character better known in England by the
title of abbot or lord of misrule, “who,” says Percy, “in the
houses of our nobility presided over the Christmas gambols,
and promoted mirth and jollity at that festive season”
(Northumberland Household Book, notes, p. 441).</p></div>

History of Whitby, York, 1779, p. 146. “It was always believed,”
adds the worthy pedagogue, “that these butts had been erected by him
for that very purpose, till the year 1771, when this popular notion was
discovered to be a mistake; they being no more than the barrows or
tumuli thrown up by our pagan predecessors on interring their leaders
or the other persons of distinction amongst them. However, notwithstanding
this discovery, there is no doubt but Robin Hood made use of
those houes or butts when he was disposed to exercise his men, and
wanted to train them up in hitting a mark.” Be that as it may, there
are a few hillocks of a similar nature not far from Guisbrough, which
likewise bear the name of Robin Hood’s butts; and others, it is imagined,
may be met with in other parts.</p></div>

<p class="pfirst">This ancient legend is printed from the copy of
an edition, in 4to and black letter, by Wynken de Worde, preserved
in the public library at Cambridge; compared with, and, in some
places, corrected by, another impression (apparently from the
former), likewise in 4to and black letter, by William Copland,
a copy of which is among the late Mr. Garrick’s old plays, now
in the British Museum. The full title of the first edition is
as follows: “Here beginneth a mery geste of Robyn Hode and his
meyne, <span class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span> and of the proude
sheryfe of Notyngham;” and the printer’s colophon runs thus:
“Explycit. Kynge Edwarde and Robyn hode and Lytell Johan Enprented
at London in Flete strete at the sygne of the sone By Wynken de
Worde.” To Copland’s edition is added “a newe playe for to be
played in Maye games very plesaunte and full of pastyme;” which
will be found at large in another place. No other copy of either
edition is known to be extant; but, by the favour of the Reverend
Dr. Farmer, the editor had in his hands and gave to Mr. Douce a
few leaves of an old 4to black letter impression by the above
Wynken de Worde, probably in 1489, and totally unknown to Ames
and Herbert. Another edition was printed at Edinburgh by Androw
Myllar and Walter Chepman in 1508, a fragment whereof is in the
Advocates’ Library there. This is probably the edition noticed
among the tales enumerated in Wedderburn’s Complainte of Scotland,
printed at St. Andrews in 1549, under the title of “Robene Hude and
litil Jhone.” Among the Doctor’s numerous literary curiosities was
likewise another edition, “printed,” after Copland’s, “for Edward
White” (4to, black letter, no date, but entered in the Stationers’
books 13 May 1594), which hath been collated, and every variation
worthy of notice either adopted or remarked in the margin. The only
deviation from all the copies (except in necessary corrections)
is the division of stanzas, the indenting of the lines, the
addition of points, the disuse of abbreviations, and the occasional
introduction or rejection of a capital letter; liberties, if they
may be so called, which have been taken with most of the other
poems in this collection.</p>

ROBYN HODE [AND THE POTTER].</span></h3>

<div class="fsz6">
<p class="pfirst">This
curious, and hitherto unpublished, and even unheard of,
old piece is given from a manuscript among Bishop More’s collections,
in the public library of the University of Cambridge
(Ee. 4. 35). The writing, which is evidently that of a vulgar
and illiterate person, appears to be of the age of Henry the
Seventh, that is, about the year 1500; but the composition (which
he has irremediably corrupted) is probably of an earlier period,
and much older, no doubt, than “The Play of Robyn Hode,”
which seems allusive to the same story. At the end of the
original is “Expleycyt Robyn Hode.”

<h3>III.
<span class="hsmall">ROBIN HOOD AND THE BEGGAR.</span></h3>

<div class="fsz6">
<p class="pfirst">This poem, a North-country (or perhaps Scotish) composition
of some antiquity, is given from a modern copy printed at Newcastle,
where it was accidentally picked up: no other edition
having been ever seen or heard of. The corruptions of the press
being equally numerous and minute, some of the most trifling
have been corrected without notice. But it may be proper to
mention that each line of the printed copy is here thrown into
two: a step which, though absolutely necessary from the narrowness
of the page, is sufficiently justified by the frequent recurrence
of the double rime. The division of stanzas was conceived to be
a still further improvement.—The original title is, “A Pretty
Dialogue betwixt Robin Hood and a Beggar.”</p>

<p>A similar story (“Comment un moine se débarasse des
voleurs”) may be found in “Le Moyen de Parvenir,” i. 304 (edit.
1739). <span class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span></p>

<div class="dpv01">That be of high born blood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">I’ll tell you of a brave bootìng</div>
<div class="dpv01">That befell Robin Hood.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Robin Hood upon a day,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He went forth him alone,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And as he came from Barnsdale</div>
<div class="dpv01">Into fair evenìng,</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He met a beggar on the way,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Who sturdily could gang&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">He had a pike-staff in his hand</div>
<div class="dpv01">That was both stark and strang&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">A clouted clock about him was,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That held him frae the cold,</div>
<div class="dpv00">The thinnest bit of it, I guess,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Was more than twenty fold.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">His meal-poke hang about his neck,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Into a leathern whang,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Well fasten’d to a broad bucle,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That was both stark and ‘strang.’</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He had three hats upon his head,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Together sticked fast,</div>
<div class="dpv00">He car’d neither for wind nor wet,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Good Robin cast him in the way,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Tarry, tarry, good Robin says,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Tarry, and speak with me.</div>

<div class="dpv00">Sir, you must lend me some monèy</div>
<div class="dpv01">Till we meet again.</div>

<h4 class="h4herein">THE SECOND PART.</h4>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now three of Robin’s men, by chance,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Came walking by the way,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And found their master in a trance,</div>
<div class="dpv01">On ground where that he lay.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Up have they taken good Robìn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Making a piteous bear,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Yet saw they no man there at whom</div>
<div class="dpv01">They might the matter spear.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They looked him all round about,</div>
<div class="dpv01">But wound on him saw ‘nane,’</div>
<div class="dpv00">Yet at his mouth came bocking out</div>
<div class="dpv01">The blood of a good vain.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Cold water they have gotten syne,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And cast unto his face&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then he began to hitch his ear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And speak within short space.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Tell us, dear master, said his men,</div>
<div class="dpv01">How with you stands the case.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Good Robin sigh’d e’er he began</div>
<div class="dpv01">To tell of his disgrace. <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“I have been watchman in this wood</div>
<div class="dpv01">Near hand this twenty year,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Yet I was never so hard bestead</div>
<div class="dpv01">As ye have found me here&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">A beggar with a clouted clock,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of whom I fear’d no ill</div>
<div class="dpv00">Hath with his pyke-staff cla’d my back,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I fear ’twill never be well.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">See, where he goes o’er yon hill,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With hat upon his head&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">If e’er ye lov’d your master well,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Go now revenge this deed&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And bring him back again to me,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If it lie in your might,</div>
<div class="dpv00">That I may see, before I die,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Him punish’d in my sight&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And if you may not bring him back,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Let him not go loose on&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For to us all it were great shame</div>
<div class="dpv01">If he escape again.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“One of us shall with you remain,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Because you’re ill at ease,</div>
<div class="dpv00">The other two shall bring him back,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To use him as you please.” <span class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now, by my truth, says good Robìn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I true there’s enough said&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And he get scouth to wield his tree,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I fear you’ll both be paid.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“Be not fear’d, our mastèr,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That we two can be dung</div>
<div class="dpv00">With any bluter base beggàr,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That has nought but a rung.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">His staff shall stand him in no stead,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That you shall shortly see,</div>
<div class="dpv00">But back again he shall be led,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And fast bound shall he be,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To see if ye will have him slain,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Or hanged on a tree.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“But cast you sliely in his way,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Before he be aware,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And on his pyke-staff first hands lay,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Ye’ll speed the better far.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now leave we Robin with this man,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Again to play the child,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And learn himself to stand and gang</div>
<div class="dpv01">By halds, for all his eild.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now pass we to the bold beggàr,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That raked o’er the hill,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Who never mended his pace more,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Then he had done no ill. <span class="xxpn" id="p106">{106}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpvctr"><hr class="hrpv0" /></div>
<div class="dpvctr"><hr class="hrpv1" /></div>
<div class="dpv00">And they have taken another way,<a
 class="afnanc" href="#fn260" id="fnanc260">260</a></div>
<div class="dpv01">Was nearer by miles three.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They stoutly ran with all their might,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Spared neither dub ‘nor’ mire,</div>
<div class="dpv00">They started at neither how nor height,</div>
<div class="dpv01">No travel made them tire,</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Till they before the beggar wan,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And cast them in his way&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">A little wood lay in a glen,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And there they both did stay&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They stood up closely by a tree,</div>
<div class="dpv01">In each side of the gate,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Untill the beggar came them nigh,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That thought of no such late&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And as he was betwixt them past,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They leapt upon him baith&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">The one his pyke-staff gripped fast,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They feared for its skaith.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The other he held in his sight</div>
<div class="dpv01">A drawen durk to his breast,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And said, False ‘carel,’ quit thy staff,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Or I shall be thy priest. <span class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">His pyke-staff they have taken him frae,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And stuck it in the green,</div>
<div class="dpv00">He was full loath to let it gae,</div>
<div class="dpv01">An better might it been.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The beggar was the feardest man</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of any that e’er might be,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To win away no way he can,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Nor help him with his tree.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Nor wist he wherefore he was ta’en,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Nor how many was there&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">He thought his life days had been gane,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He grew into dispair.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Grant me my life, the beggar said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For him that dy’d on the tree,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And hold away that ugly knife,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Or else for fear I’ll die.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">I griev’d you never in all my life,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Neither by late or air,</div>
<div class="dpv00">You have great sin if you would slay</div>
<div class="dpv01">A silly poor beggàr.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Thou lies, false lown, they said again,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For all that may be sworn&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Thou hast ‘near’ slain the gentlest man</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of one that e’er was born&#x202f;; <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And back again thou shall be led,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And fast bound shalt thou be,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To see if he will have thee slain,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Or hanged on a tree.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The beggar then thought all was wrong,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They were set for his wrack,</div>
<div class="dpv00">He saw nothing appearing then</div>
<div class="dpv01">But ill upon warse back.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Were he out of their hands, he thought,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And had again his tree,</div>
<div class="dpv00">He should not be led back for nought,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With such as he did see.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then he bethought him on a wile,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If it could take effect,</div>
<div class="dpv00">How he might the young men beguile,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And give them a begeck.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn261" id="fnanc261">261</a></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Thus to do them shame for ill</div>
<div class="dpv01">His beastly breast was bent,</div>
<div class="dpv00">He found the wind blew something shrill,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To further his intent.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He said, Brave gentlemen, be good,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And let a poor man be&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">When ye have taken a beggar’s blood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">It helps you not a flee. <span class="xxpn" id="p109">{109}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">It was but in my own defence,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If he has gotten skaith&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">But I will make a recompence</div>
<div class="dpv01">Is better for you baith.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">If ye will set me fair and free,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And do me no more dear,</div>
<div class="dpv00">An hundred pounds I will you give,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And much more odd silvèr,</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">That I have gather’d this many years,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Under this clouted cloak,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And hid up wonder privately,</div>
<div class="dpv01">In bottom of my poke.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The young men to the council yeed,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn262" id="fnanc262">262</a></div>
<div class="dpv01">And let the beggar gae&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">They wist full well he had no speed</div>
<div class="dpv01">From them to run away.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They thought they would the money take,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Come after what so may&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And yet they would not take him back,</div>
<div class="dpv01">But in that place him slay.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">By that good Robin would not know</div>
<div class="dpv01">That they had gotten coin,</div>
<div class="dpv00">It would content him [well] to show</div>
<div class="dpv01">That there they had him slain, <span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They said, False carel, soon have done,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And tell forth thy monèy,</div>
<div class="dpv00">For the ill turn that thou hast done</div>
<div class="dpv01">It’s but a simple plee.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And yet we will not have thee back,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Come after what so may,</div>
<div class="dpv00">If thou will do that which thou spak,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn263" id="fnanc263">263</a></div>
<div class="dpv01">And make us present pay.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O then he loosed his clouted clock,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And spread it on the ground,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And thereon lay he many a poke,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Betwixt them and the wind.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He took a great bag from his hals,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn264" id="fnanc264">264</a></div>
<div class="dpv01">It was near full of meal,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Two pecks in it at least there was,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And more, I wot full well.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Upon this cloak he set it down,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The mouth he opened wide,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To turn the same he made him bown,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn265" id="fnanc265">265</a></div>
<div class="dpv01">The young men ready spy’d&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">In every hand he took a nook</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of that great leathren ‘mail,’&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn266" id="fnanc266">266</a></div>
<div class="dpv00">And with a fling the meal he shook</div>
<div class="dpv01">Into their face all hail&#x202f;: <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Wherewith he blinded them so close,</div>
<div class="dpv01">A stime they could not see&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And then in heart he did rejoice,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And clap’d his lusty tree.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He thought if he had done them wrong,</div>
<div class="dpv01">In mealing of their cloaths,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn267" id="fnanc267">267</a></div>
<div class="dpv00">For to strike off the meal again</div>
<div class="dpv01">With his pyke-staff he goes.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">E’er any of them could red their een,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Or a glimmring might see,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Ilke one of them a dozen had,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Well laid on with his tree.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The young men were right swift of foot,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And boldly bound away,</div>
<div class="dpv00">The beggar could them no more hit,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For all the haste he may.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">What’s all this haste&#x202f;? the beggar said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">May not you<a class="afnanc" href="#fn268" id="fnanc268">268</a> tarry still,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Untill your money be received&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv01">I’ll pay you with good will.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The shaking of my pokes, I fear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Hath blown into your een&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">But I have a good pyke-staff here</div>
<div class="dpv01">Can ripe them out full clean. <span class="xxpn" id="p112">{112}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The young men answered never a word,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They were dum as a stane&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">In the thick wood the beggar fled,</div>
<div class="dpv01">E’er they riped their een&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And syne the night became so late,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To seek him was in vain&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">But judge ye if they looked blate</div>
<div class="dpv01">When they cam home again.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Good Robin speer’d how they had sped.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn269" id="fnanc269">269</a></div>
<div class="dpv01">They answered him, Full ill.</div>
<div class="dpv00">That can not be, good Robin says,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Ye have been at the mill.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The mill it is a meat-rife part,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They may lick what they please,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Most like ye have been at the art,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Who would look at your ‘claiths.’&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn270" id="fnanc270">270</a></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They hang’d their heads, they drooped down,</div>
<div class="dpv01">A word they could not speak.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Robin said, Because I fell a-sound,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I think ye’ll do the like.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Tell on the matter, less or more,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And tell me what and how</div>

<div class="dpv01">I sent you for right now. <span class="xxpn" id="p113">{113}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And when they told him to an end,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As i have said before,</div>
<div class="dpv00">How that the beggar did them blind,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpvctr"><hr class="hrpv0" /></div>

<div class="dpv01">E’er they a stime could see&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And how they scarcely could win home,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Their bones were baste so sore&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Good Robin cry’d, Fy&#x202f;! out&#x202f;! for

<div class="dpv01">We’re sham’d for evermore.</div>

ROBIN HOOD AND GUY OF GISBORNE,</span></h3>

<div class="fsz6">
<p class="pcontinue">is reprinted from the “Reliques of Ancient
English Poetry,” published by Dr. Percy (vol. i. p. 81), who
there gives it from his “folio MS.” as “never before printed, and
‘carrying’ marks of much greater antiquity than any of the common
popular songs on this subject.”</p>

<p>As for Guy of Gisborne, the only further memorial which has
occurred concerning him is in an old satirical piece by William
Dunbar, a celebrated Scotish poet of the 15th century, on one
“Schir Thomas Nory” (MS. Maitland, p. 3; MSS. More, Ll. 5, 10),
where he is named along with our hero, Adam Bell, and other
worthies, it is conjectured, of a similar stamp, but whose merits
have not, less fortunately, come to the knowledge of posterity.

York, on the borders of Lancashire.</p>

<p>In the fourth edition of the publication above referred to, which
appeared in July 1795, it is acknowleged that “some liberties
were, by the editor, taken with this ballad, which in this edition
hath been brought nearer to the folio MS.” The new readings
have therefore been introduced into the present text.</p>

<span class="hsmall">
A TRUE TALE OF ROBIN HOOD:</span>
<span class="hsmall">
<span class="fsz7">OR,</span></span></h3>

<p>A briefe touch of the life and death of that
renowned outlaw Robert earl of Huntingdon, vulgarly called
Robin Hood, who lived and dyed in A. D. 1198,<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn277" id="fnanc277">277</a> being the 9th year of king
Richard the first, commonly called Richard Cœur de Lyon.</p>

<p>Carefully collected out of the truest writers of our
English Chronicles: and published for the satisfaction
of those who desire truth from falshood.</p>

<div class="fsz6">BY MARTIN PARKER. <span class="xxpn"
id="p127">{127}</span></div>

<div class="fsz6 padtopb">
<p>This poem, given from an edition in black letter printed for
I. Clarke, W. Thackeray, and T. Passinger, 1686, remaining in
the curious library left by Anthony a Wood, appears to have
been first entered on the hall-book of the Stationers’ Company
the 29th of February 1631.</p>

<p>Martin Parker was a great writer of ballads, several of which,
with his initials subjoined, are still extant in the Pepysian and
other collections. (See “Ancient Songs,” 1829, ii. p. 263.)
Dr. Percy mentions a little miscellany intitled, “The garland
of withered roses, by Martin Parker, 1656.” The editor has,
likewise, seen “The nightingale warbling forth her own disaster,
or the rape of Philomela: newly written in English verse
by Martin Parker, 1632;” and, on the 24th of November
1640, Mr. Oulton enters at Stationers’ Hall “a book called
The true story of Guy earle of Warwicke, in prose, by Martyn
Parker.”</p>

<p>At the end of this poem the author adds “The epitaph which
the prioress of the monastry of Kirkslay in Yorkshire set over
Robin Hood, which,” he says, “(as is before mentioned) was
to be read within these hundred years, though in old broken
English, much to the same sence and meaning.” He gives it
thus:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft">
<p class="phanga">“Decembris quarto die, 1198. anno regni Richardi
 primi 9.</p>
<div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“Robert earl of Hun­ting­ton</div>
<div class="dpv00">“Lies under this little stone,</div>
<div class="dpv00">“No archer was like him so good;</div>
<div class="dpv00">“His wildness named him Robin Hood;</div>
<div class="dpv00">“Full thirteen years, and something more,</div>
<div class="dpv00">“These northern parts he vexed sore;</div>
<div class="dpv00">“Such outlaws as he and his men</div>
<div class="dpv00">“May England never know again.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Some other superstitious words,” he adds, “were in, which
I,” says he, “thought fit to leave out.” Now, under this precise
gentleman’s favour, one would be glad to know what these same
“superstitious words” were; there not being
anything of the <span class="xxpn" id="p128">{128}</span>
kind in Dr. Gale’s copy, which seems to be the original, and
which is shorter by two lines than the above. Thirteen should
be thirty.</p>

<div class="dpv00">That such a worthy man as he</div>

<div class="dpv00">The long bow and the arrow keen</div>

<div class="dpv00">Poor men might safely pass by him,</div>

<div class="dpv01">He evermore did use. <span class="xxpn" id="p137">{137}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But where he knew a miser rich</div>
<div class="dpv01">That did the poor oppress,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To feel his coyn his hands did itch,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He’d have it, more or less&#x202f;:</div>

<div class="dpv00">So that, through dread of Robin then,</div>

<div class="dpv00">King Richard, of that name the first,</div>

<div class="dpv00">The bishop of Ely, chancellor,</div>

<div class="dpv00">He, riding down towards the north,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And with the gallant gray-goose wing</div>
<div class="dpv01">They shew’d to them such play</div>

<div class="dpv01">And down their riders lay,</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Full glad and fain the bishop was,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Two hundred of his men were kill’d,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Thirty, who did as captives yield,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Were carried to the green wood&#x202f;;</div>

<div class="dpv00">Which afterwards were ransomed,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For twenty marks a man&#x202f;:</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The bishop, sore inraged, then</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But Robin with his courtesie</div>
<div class="dpv01">So won the meaner sort,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So that bold Robin and his train</div>
<div class="dpv01">Did live unhurt of them,</div>

<div class="dpv00">And then the talk of Robin Hood</div>
<div class="dpv01">His royal ears did fill&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">His grace admir’d that i’ th’ green wood</div>
<div class="dpv01">He was continued still.</div>

<div class="dpv00">So that the country far and near</div>

<div class="dpv01">But such as broke the laws.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He wished well unto the king,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Only, because he was undone</div>

<div class="dpv00">With wealth that he by roguery got</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Such was their blind devotion then,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Nor would he injure husbandmen,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The king in person, with some lords,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And, as he once before had done,</div>

<div class="dpv01">A letter to his grace</div>

This saint is also mentioned by Chaucer in the Sompnour’s
tale; by Spenser, in his 5th eclogue; in the Downfall of Robert
Earl of Hun­ting­ton, 1601; and in one of Ophelia’s songs in
Hamlet. (See a note upon this last passage in the edition of
1793, vol. xv. p. 163.) Mr. Steevens’s assertion that “Saint
Charity is a known saint among the Roman Catholics,” may be
supported by infallible authority. “We read,” says Dr. Douglas,
“in the Martyrology on the first of August—Romæ passio
sanctarum virginum, Fidei, Spei, et Charitatis, quæ sub Hadriano
principe martyris coronam adeptæ sunt” (Criterion, p. 68).
Pierre Nadal, commonly called Petrus de Natalibus, in his
Catalogus Sanctorum, has given the history of the saints Faith,
Hope, and Charity, the daughters of St. Sophia (or Wisdom).
Nothing can be too absurd for superstition.</p></div>

instance, at least, it is believed, admitting this to be one,

There is no authority for imputing this
execrable practice to our hero or his companions, in any one
single instance. If, however, the lex talionis were at all
justifiable, they certainly had sufficient provocation to
exercise it—not, indeed, upon the clergy, in particular,
but upon the king, his ministers, judges, and nobles. “The
ancient punishment for killing the king’s deer,” says Dr.
Percy, “was loss of eyes and castration: a punishment far
worse than death!”</p></div>

<div class="fsz6">
<p class="pfirst">From a black letter copy in the large and
valuable collection of old ballads late belonging to Thomas
Pearson, Esq., and now in the possession of the Duke of Roxburghe.
This is the collection mentioned in the Harleian Catalogue, and
would seem to be the greater part of that originally made by
old Bagford (see Hearne’s Appendix to Hemingi Chartularium, p.
662), another volume or two having come, with the rest of his
typographical collections, to the British Museum. The three vols.
which went to Osborne were probably bought of him by Mr. West,
at whose sale they <span class="xxpn" id="p150">{150}</span>
were purchased by Major Pearson, by whom the collection was
new-arranged, ornamented, and improved.</p>

<p>In reading this song, we are admonished by the editor of the
collection of old ballads printed in 1723 (who thinks it “the most
beautiful and one of the oldest extant, written on that subject”)
to observe one thing, “and that is, between some of the stanzas
we must suppose a considerable time to pass. Clorinda,” he says,
“might be [thought] a very forward girl, if between Robin Hood’s
question and her answer we did not suppose two or three hours
to have been spent in courtship; and between Robin Hood’s being
entertained at Gamwell-hall and his having ninety-three bowmen in
Sherwood, we must allow some years.”</p>

<p>With respect to its antiquity, Dr. Percy, in the new edition
of his “Reliques of Ancient English Poetry” (vol. i. p.
xcvii.), expresses a very different opinion; since, according
to him, it “seems of much later date than most of the others,
and can scarce be older than the reign of King Charles I.;
<span class="smmaj">FOR</span>,” says he, “King James I. had
no issue after his accession to the throne of England:” an
observation which, if any way to the purpose, is certainly <span
class="smmaj">NOT TRUE</span>. “It may even,” he continues, “have
been written since the Restoration, and only express the wishes
of the nation for issue on the marriage of their favourite King
Charles II. on his marriage (<i>sic</i>) with the infanta of Portugal.”
However this may be, the writer’s having deviated from “all the old
traditions concerning this celebrated outlaw,” is no proof that
he was “ignorant” of them; and that Dr. Percy chooses to “think
it is not found in the Pepys Collection” only shows conjecture to
be easier than investigation.
<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/index.jpg" width="90"
height="90" alt="☞" />&#x202f;In
the second volume of
that collection, any person disposed to the search will find at
least <span class="smmaj">TWO COPIES</span> of it, both in black
letter.</p>

<p>The full title of the original is: “A new ballad of bold Robin
Hood; shewing his birth, breeding, valour, and marriage at Titbury
Bull-running. Calculated for the meridian of Staffordshire,
but may serve for Derbyshire or Kent.” <span class="xxpn"

<div class="dpv00">In Locksly town, in merry Not­ting­ham­shire,</div>
<div class="dpv01">In merry sweet Locksly town,</div>
<div class="dpv00">There bold Robin Hood he was born and was bred,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Bold Robin of famous renown.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The father of Robin a forrester was,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And he shot in a lusty strong bow</div>
<div class="dpv00">Two north-country miles and an inch at a shot,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As the Pinder of Wakefield does know.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">For he brought Adam Bell, and Clim of the Clugh,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And William of ‘Clowdesle,’&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn281" id="fnanc281">281</a></div>
<div class="dpv00">To shoot with our forrester for forty mark,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And the forrester beat them all three.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">His mother was neece to the Coventry knight,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which Warwickshire men call sir Guy&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For he slew the blue bore that hangs up at the gate,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Or mine host of the Bull tells a lie. <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Her brother was Gamwel, of Great Gamwel-hall,</div>
<div class="dpv01">A noble house-keeper was he,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Ay, as ever broke bread in sweet Not­ting­ham­shire,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And a ’squire of famous degree.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The mother of Robin said to her husbànd,</div>
<div class="dpv01">My honey, my love, and my dear,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Let Robin and I ride this morning to Gamwel,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To taste of my brother’s good cheer.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And he said, I grant thee thy boon, gentle Joan,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Take one of my horses, I pray&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">The sun is arising, and therefore make haste,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For to-morrow is Christmas-day.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin Hood’s father’s grey gelding was brought,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And sadled and bridled was he&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">God-wot a blue bonnet, his new suit of cloaths,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And a cloak that did reach to his knee.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">She got on her holyday kirtle and gown,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They were of a light Lincoln green&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">The cloath was homespun, but for colour and make</div>
<div class="dpv01">It might ‘have beseemed’&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn282" id="fnanc282">282</a> our queen.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And then Robin got on his basket-hilt sword,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And his dagger on his tother side&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And said, My dear mother, let’s haste to be gone,</div>
<div class="dpv01">We have forty long miles to ride. <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When Robin had mounted his gelding so grey,</div>
<div class="dpv01">His father, without any trouble,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Set her up behind him, and bad her not fear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For his gelding ‘had’ oft carried double.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And when she was<a class="afnanc" href="#fn283" id="fnanc283">283</a> settled, they rode to their neighbours,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And drank and shook hands with them all&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And then Robin gallopt, and never gave o’re,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Till they lighted at Gamwel-hall.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And now you may think the right worshipful squire</div>
<div class="dpv01">Was joyful his sister to see&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For he kist her, and kist her, and swore a great oath,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Thou art welcome, kind sister, to me.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">To-morrow, when mass had been said at the chappel,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Six tables were covered in the hall,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And in comes the squire, and makes a short speech,</div>
<div class="dpv01">It was, Neighbours, you’re welcome all.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But not a man here shall taste my March beer,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Till a Christmas carrol he does sing.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then all clapt their hands, and theys houted and sung,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Till the hall and the parlour did ring.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now mustard and brawn, roast beef and plumb pies</div>
<div class="dpv01">Were set upon every table&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And noble George Gamwel said, Eat and be merry,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And drink too as long as you’re able. <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When dinner was ended, his chaplain said grace,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And, Be merry, my friends, said the squire&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">It rains and it blows, but call for more ale,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And lay some more wood on the fire.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And now call ye Little John hither to me,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For Little John is a fine lad,</div>
<div class="dpv00">At gambols and juggling, and twenty such tricks,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As shall make you both merry and glad.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When Little John came, to gambols they went,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Both gentlemen, yeomen, and clown&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And what do you think&#x202f;? Why, as true as I live,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Bold Robin Hood put them all down.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And now you may think the right worshipful squire</div>
<div class="dpv01">Was joyful this sight for to see&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For he said, Cousin Robin, thou’st go no more home,</div>
<div class="dpv01">But tarry and dwell here with me&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Thou shalt have my land when I die, and till then,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Thou shalt be the staff of my age.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then grant me my boon, dear uncle, said Robin,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That Little John may be my page.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And he said, Kind cousin, I grant thee thy boon&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">With all my heart, so let it be.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then come hither, Little John, said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Come hither my page unto me&#x202f;: <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Go fetch me my bow, my longest long bow,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And broad arrows, one, two, or three.</div>
<div class="dpv00">For when ’tis fair weather we’ll into Sherwood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Some merry pastime to see.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When Robin Hood came into merry Sherwood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He winded his bugle so clear&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And twice five and twenty good yeomen and bold,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Before Robin Hood did appear.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Where are your companions all&#x202f;? said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For still I want forty and three.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then said a bold yeoman, Lo, yonder they stand,</div>
<div class="dpv01">All under the<a class="afnanc" href="#fn284" id="fnanc284">284</a> green wood tree.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">As that word was spoke, Clorinda came by,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The queen of the shepherds was she&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And her gown was of velvet as green as the grass,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And her buskin did reach to her knee.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Her gate it was graceful, her body was straight,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And her countenance free from pride&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">A bow in her hand, and a quiver of arrows</div>
<div class="dpv01">Hung dangling by her sweet side.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Her eye-brows were black, ay, and so was her hair,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And her skin was as smooth as glass&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Her visage spoke wisdom, and modesty too&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv01">Sets with Robin Hood such a lass&#x202f;! <span class="xxpn" id="p156">{156}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Said Robin Hood, Lady fair, whither away&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv01">O whither, fair lady, away&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv00">And she made him answer, To kill a fat buck&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">For to-morrow is Titbury day.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Said Robin Hood, Lady fair, wander with me</div>
<div class="dpv01">A little to yonder green bower&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">There set down to rest you, and you shall be sure</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of a brace or a ‘leash’&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn285" id="fnanc285">285</a> in an hour.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And as we were going towàrds the green bower,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Two hundred good bucks we espy’d&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">She chose<a class="afnanc" href="#fn286" id="fnanc286">286</a> out the fattest that was in the herd,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And she shot him through side and side.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">By the faith of my body, said bold Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I never saw woman like thee&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And com’st thou from east, or com’st thou from west,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Thou needst not beg venison of me.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">However, along to my bower you shall go,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And taste of a forrester’s meat&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">And when we came thither we found as good cheer</div>
<div class="dpv01">As any man needs for to eat.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">For there was hot venison, and warden pies cold,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Cream clouted, and honey-combs plenty&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And the servitors they were, besides Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Good yeomen, at least four and twenty. <span class="xxpn" id="p157">{157}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Clorinda said, Tell me your name, gentle sir&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv01">And he said, ’Tis bold Robin Hood&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Squire Gamwel’s my uncle, but all my delight</div>
<div class="dpv01">Is to dwell in the merry Sherwood&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">For ’tis a fine life, and ’tis void of all strife.</div>
<div class="dpv01">So ’tis, sir, Clorinda reply’d.</div>
<div class="dpv00">But oh&#x202f;! said bold Robin, how sweet would it be,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If Clorinda would be my bride&#x202f;!</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">She blusht at the motion&#x202f;; yet, after a pause,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Said, Yes, sir, and with all my heart.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then let us send for a priest, said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And be married before we do part.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But she said, It may not be so, gentle sir,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For I must be at Titbury feast&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And if Robin Hood will go thither with me,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I’ll make him the most welcome guest.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Said Robin Hood, Reach me that buck, Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For I’ll go along with my dear&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And bid my yeomen kill six brace of bucks,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And meet me to-morrow just here.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Before he had ridden five Staffordshire miles,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Eight yeomen, that were too bold,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Bid Robin Hood stand, and deliver his buck&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv01">A truer tale never was told. <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">I will not, faith, said bold Robin&#x202f;; come, John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Stand by me, and we’ll beat ’em all.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then both drew their swords, and so cut ’em, and slasht ’em,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That five out of them did fall.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The three that remain’d call’d to Robin for quarter,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And pitiful John begg’d their lives&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">When John’s boon was granted, he gave them good counsel,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And sent them all home to their wives.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">This battle was fought near to Titbury town,</div>
<div class="dpv01">When the bagpipes baited the bull&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">I’m the king of the fidlers, and I swear ’tis truth,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And I call him that doubts it a gull&#x202f;:<a class="afnanc" href="#fn287" id="fnanc287">287</a></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">For I saw them fighting, and fiddled the while&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">And Clorinda sung “Hey derry down&#x202f;!</div>
<div class="dpv00">The bumkins are beaten, put up thy sword, Bob,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And now let’s dance into the town.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Before we came in we heard a great shouting,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And all that were in it look’d madly&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For some were on bull-back, some dancing a morris,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And some singing <i>Arthur-a-Bradley</i>.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn288" id="fnanc288">288</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p159">{159}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And there we see Thomas, our justices clerk,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And Mary, to whom he was kind&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For Tom rode before her, and call’d Mary madam,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And kiss’d her full sweetly behind&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And so may your worships. But we went to dinner,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With Thomas and Mary, and Nan&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">They all drank a health to Clorinda, and told her,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Bold Robin Hood was a fine man.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When dinner was ended, sir Roger, the parson</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of Dubbridge, was sent for in haste&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">He brought his mass-book, and he bad them take hands,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And joyn’d them in marriage full fast.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And then, as bold Robin Hood and his sweet bride</div>
<div class="dpv01">Went hand in hand to the green bower,</div>
<div class="dpv00">The birds sung with pleasure in merry Sherwood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And ’twas a most joyful hour.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And when Robin came in sight of the bower,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Where are my yeomen&#x202f;? said he&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">And Little John answer’d, Lo, yonder they stand,</div>
<div class="dpv01">All under the green-wood-tree.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then a garland they brought her by two and by two,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And plac’d them all on the bride’s head&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">The music struck up, and we all fell to dance,</div>
<div class="dpv01">’Till the bride and bridegroom were a-bed. <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And what they did there must be counsel to me,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Because they lay long the next day&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And I had haste home, but I got a good piece</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of bride-cake, and so came away.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now, out, alas&#x202f;! I had forgotten to tell ye,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That marry’d they were with a ring&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And so will Nan Knight, or be buried a maiden&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv01">And now let us pray for the king&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">That he may get children, and they may get more,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To govern and do us some good&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">And then I’ll make ballads in Robin Hood’s bower</div>
<div class="dpv01">And sing ’em in merry Sherwood.</div>

The paragraph of which the following is an extract appeared
in the evening paper intitled “The Star,” April 23, 1796:
“A few days ago as some labourers were digging in a garden
at Fox-lane, near Nottingham, they discovered six human
skeletons entire, deposited in regular order side
by side, supposed <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span>
to be part of the fifteen foresters that were killed by Robin Hood.
Near the above place anciently stood a church, built in the early
ages of Christianity, dedicated to St. Michael, which was totally
demolished at the Reformation. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No doubt but the bones in
question were properly buried in St. Michael’s churchyard. The
proprietors of the garden humanely ordered the pit where the
bones were found to be filled up, being unwilling to disturb the
relics of humanity and the ashes of the dead.”</p>

THE JOLLY PINDER OF WAKEFIELD, WITH

<div class="fsz6">
<p class="pfirst">From
an old black letter copy in Anthony a Wood’s collection,
compared with two others in the British Museum, one in
black letter. It should be sung “To an excellent tune,” which
has not been recovered.</p>

<p>Several lines of this ballad are quoted in the two old plays of
the “Downfall” and “Death of Robert, Earle of Hun­ting­ton,”
1601, 4to, b. l., but acted many years before. It is also alluded
to in Shakespeare’s Merry Wives of Windsor, act i. scene 1, and
again in his Second Part of King Henry IV., act v. scene 3.</p>

<p>In 1557 certain “ballets” are entered on the books of the
Stationers’ Company “to John Wallye and Mrs. Toye,” one of
which is entitled “Of wakefylde and a grene:” meaning apparently
the ballad here reprinted. <span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span></p>

<div class="dpv01">As fast as I can hie. <span class="xxpn" id="p178">{178}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But when to the sheriffs house they came.</div>
<div class="dpv01">To dinner they hied apace,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And Robin Hood he the man must be</div>
<div class="dpv01">Before them all to say grace.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Pray god bless us all, said jolly Robìn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And our meat within this place&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">A cup of sack so good will nourish our blood</div>
<div class="dpv01">And so I do end my grace.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Come fill us more wine, said jolly Robìn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Let us be merry while we do stay&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For wine and good cheer, be it never so dear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I vow I the reckning will pay.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Come, ‘brothers,’ be merry, said jolly Robìn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Let us drink, and never give ore&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For the shot I will pay, ere I go my way,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If it cost me five pounds and more.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">This is a mad blade, the butchers then said.</div>
<div class="dpv01">Saies the sheriff, He is some prodigal,</div>
<div class="dpv00">That some land has sold for silver and gold,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And now he doth mean to spend all.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Hast thou any horn beasts, the sheriff repli’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Good fellow, to sell unto me&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv00">“Yes, that I have, good master sheriff,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I have hundreds two or three, <span class="xxpn" id="p179">{179}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And a hundred aker of good free land,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If you please it to see&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">And Ile make you as good assurance of it,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As ever my father made me.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The sheriff he saddled his good palfrèy,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And, with three hundred pound in gold,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Away he went with bold Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">His horned beasts to behold.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Away then the sheriff and Robin did ride,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To the forrest of merry Sherwood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then the sheriff did say, God bless us this day,</div>
<div class="dpv01">From a man they call Robin Hood&#x202f;!</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But when a little farther they came,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Bold Robin he chanced to spy</div>
<div class="dpv00">A hundred head of good red deer,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Come tripping the sheriff full nigh.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“How like you my horn’d beasts, good master sheriff&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv01">They be fat and fair for to see.”</div>
<div class="dpv00">“I tell thee, good fellow, I would I were gone,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For I like not thy company.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin set his horn to his mouth,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And blew but blasts three&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then quickly anon there came Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And all his company. <span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">What is your will, master&#x202f;? then said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Good master, come tell unto me.</div>
<div class="dpv00">“I have brought hither the sheriff of Nottingham</div>
<div class="dpv01">This day to dine with thee.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He is welcome to me, then said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I hope he will honestly pay&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">I know he has gold, if it be but well told,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Will serve us to drink a whole day.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin took his mantle from his back,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And laid it upon the ground&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And out of the sheriffs portmantle</div>
<div class="dpv01">He told three hundred pound.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin he brought him thorow the wood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And set him on his dapple gray&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">“O have me commended to your wife at home&#x202f;:”</div>
<div class="dpv01">So Robin went laughing away.</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">In Nottingham there lives a jolly tannèr,</div>
<div class="dpv03"><i>With a hey down, down, a down, down</i>,</div>
<div class="dpv01">His name is Arthur-a-Bland&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">There is nere a squire in Not­ting­ham­shire</div>
<div class="dpv01">Dare bid bold Arthur stand. <span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With a long pike-staff upon his shouldèr,</div>
<div class="dpv01">So well he can clear his way&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">By two and by three he makes them to flee,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For he hath no list to stay.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And as he went forth, in a summers morning,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Into the ‘forrest of merry’ Sherwood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To view the red deer, that range here and there,</div>
<div class="dpv01">There met he with bold Robin Hood.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">As soon as bold Robin ‘he did’&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn293" id="fnanc293">293</a> espy,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He thought some sport he would make,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Therefore out of hand he bid him to stand,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And thus to him ‘he’ spake&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Why, what art thou, thou bold fellòw,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That ranges so boldly here&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv00">In sooth, to be brief, thou lookst like a thief,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That comes to steal our kings deer.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">For I am a keeper in this forrest,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The king puts me in trust</div>
<div class="dpv00">To look to his deer, that range here and there&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">Therefore stay thee I must.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“If thou beest a keeper in this forrèst,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And hast such a great command,</div>
<div class="dpv00">‘Yet’ thou must have more partakers in store,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Before thou make me to stand.” <span class="xxpn" id="p183">{183}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“Nay, I have no more partakers in store,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Or any that I do not need&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">But I have a staff of another oke graff,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I know it will do the deed.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">For thy sword and thy bow I care not a straw,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Nor all thine arrows to boot&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">If I get a knop upon the bare scop,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Thou can’st as well sh—e as shoote.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Speak cleanly, good fellow, said jolly Robìn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And give better terms to me&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Else Ile thee correct for thy neglect,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And make thee more mannerly.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Marry gep with a wenion&#x202f;! quod Arthur-a-Bland,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Art thou such a goodly man&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv00">I care not a fig for thy looking so big,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Mend thou thyself where thou can.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin Hood he unbuckled his belt,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And laid down his bow so long&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">He took up a staff of another oke graff,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That was both stiff and strong.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Ile yield to thy weapon, said jolly Robìn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Since thou wilt not yield to mine&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For I have a staff of another oke graff,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Not half a foot longer then thine. <span class="xxpn" id="p184">{184}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But let me measure, said jolly Robìn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Before we begin our fray&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For I’le not have mine to be longer then thine,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For that will be counted foul play.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">I pass not for length, bold Arthur reply’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">My staff is of oke so free&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Eight foot and a half, it will knock down a calf,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And I hope it will knock down thee.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin could no longer forbear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He gave him such a knock,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Quickly and soon the blood came down,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Before it was ten a clock.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Arthur he soon recovered himself,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And gave him such a knock on the crown,</div>
<div class="dpv00">That from every side of bold Robin Hoods head,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The blood came trickling down.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin raged like a wild boar,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As soon as he saw his own blood&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then Bland was in hast he laid on so fast,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As though he had been cleaving of wood.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And about, and about, and about they went,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Like two wild bores in a chase,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Striving to aim each other to maim,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Leg, arm, or any other place. <span class="xxpn" id="p185">{185}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And knock for knock they lustily dealt,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which held for two hours and more&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">That all the wood rang at every bang,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They ply’d their work so sore.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And let thy quarrel fall&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For here we may thrash our bones all to mesh,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And get no coyn at all&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And in the forrest of merry Sherwood</div>
<div class="dpv01">Heareafter thou shalt be free.</div>
<div class="dpv00">“God a mercy for ‘nought,’ my freedom I bought,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I may thank my staff, and not thee.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">What tradesman art thou&#x202f;? said jolly Robìn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Good fellow, I prithee me show&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And also me tell, in what place thou dost dwel&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv01">For both of these fain would I know.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">I am a tanner, bold Arthur reply’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">In Nottingham long have I wrought&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And if thou’lt come there, I vow and swear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I will tan thy hide for ‘nought.’</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">God-a-mercy, good fellow, said jolly Robìn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Since thou art so kind and free&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And if thou wilt tan my hide for ‘nought,’</div>
<div class="dpv01">I will do as much for thee. <span class="xxpn" id="p186">{186}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And if thou’lt forsake thy tanners trade,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And live in the green wood with me,</div>
<div class="dpv00">My name’s Robin Hood, I swear by the ‘rood,’</div>
<div class="dpv01">I will give thee both gold and fee.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">If thou be Robin Hood, bold Arthur reply’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As I think well thou art,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then here’s my hand, my name’s Arthur-a-Bland,</div>
<div class="dpv01">We two will never depart.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But tell me, O tell me, where is Little John&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of him fain would I hear&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For we are alide by the mothers side,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And he is my kinsman dear.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin Hood blew on the beugle horn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He blew full lowd and shrill&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">But quickly anon appear’d Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Come tripping down a green hill&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O what is the matter&#x202f;? then said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Master, I pray you tell&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Why do you stand with your staff in your hand&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv01">I fear all is not well.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“O man I do stand, and he makes me to stand,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The tanner that stands thee beside&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">He is a bonny blade, and master of his trade,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For soundly he hath tan’d my hide.” <span class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He is to be commended, then said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If such a feat he can do&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">If he be so stout, we will have a bout,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And he shall tan my hide too.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For as I do understand,</div>
<div class="dpv00">He’s a yeoman good, of thine own blood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For his name is Arthur-a-Bland.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Little John threw his staff away,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As far as he could it fling,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And ran out of hand to Arthur-a-Bland,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And about his neck did cling.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With loving respect, there was no neglect,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They were neither ‘nice’ nor coy,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Each other did face with a lovely grace,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And both did weep for joy.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin Hood took ‘them both’ by the hands,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And danc’d round about the oke tree&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">“For three merry men, and three merry men,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And three merry men we be&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And ever hereafter as long as we live,</div>
<div class="dpv01">We three will be ‘as’ one&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">The wood it shall ring, and the old wife sing,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of Robin Hood, Arthur, and John.”</div>

<div class="dpv01">I will make you a man.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The king would give a hundred pound</div>
<div class="dpv01">That he could but him see&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And if wee can but now him get,</div>
<div class="dpv01">It will serve thee and mee.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Let me see that warrant, said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Ile see if it bee right&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And I will do the best I can</div>
<div class="dpv01">For to take him this night. <span class="xxpn" id="p192">{192}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">That will I not, the tinker said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">None with it I will trust&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And where hee is if you’ll not tell,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Take him by force I must.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But Robin Hood perceiving well</div>
<div class="dpv01">How then the game would go,</div>
<div class="dpv00">“If you would go to Nottingham,</div>
<div class="dpv01">We shall find him I know.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The tinker had a crab-tree staff,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which was both good and strong,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Robin hee had a good strong blade&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">So they went both along.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And when they came to Nottingham,</div>
<div class="dpv01">There they both tooke their inn&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And they called for ale and wine,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To drink it was no sin.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But ale and wine they drank so fast,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That the tinker hee forgot</div>
<div class="dpv00">What thing he was about to do&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">It fell so to his lot,</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">That, while the tinker fell asleep,</div>
<div class="dpv01">‘Robin’ made haste<a class="afnanc" href="#fn294" id="fnanc294">294</a> away,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And left the tinker in the lurch,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For the great shot to pay. <span class="xxpn" id="p193">{193}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But when the tinker wakenèd,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And saw that he was gone,</div>
<div class="dpv00">He call’d then even for his host,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And thus hee made his moan&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">I had a warrant from the king,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which might have done me good,</div>
<div class="dpv00">That is to take a bold outlàw,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Some call him Robin Hood&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But now my warrant and mony’s gone,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Nothing I have to pay&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And he that promis’d to be my friend,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He is gone and fled away.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">That friend you tell on, said the host,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They call him Robin Hood&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And when that first hee met with you,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He ment you little good.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“Had I but known it had been hee,</div>
<div class="dpv01">When that I had him here,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Th’ one of us should have tri’d our might</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which should have paid full dear.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">In the mean time I will away,</div>
<div class="dpv01">No longer here Ile bide,</div>
<div class="dpv00">But I will go and seek him out,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Whatever do me betide. <span class="xxpn" id="p194">{194}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But one thing I would gladly know,</div>
<div class="dpv01">What here I have to pay.”</div>
<div class="dpv00">Ten shillings just, then said the host,</div>
<div class="dpv01">“Ile pay without delay&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Or elce take here my working-bag,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And my good hammer too&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And if that I light but on the knave,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I will then soon pay you.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The onely way, then said the host,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And not to stand in fear,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Is to seek him among the parks,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Killing of the kings deer.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The tinker hee then went with speed,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And made then no delay,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Till he had found ‘bold’ Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That they might have a fray.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">At last hee spy’d him in a park,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Hunting then of the deer.</div>
<div class="dpv00">What knave is that, quoth Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That doth come mee so near&#x202f;?</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">No knave, no knave, the tinker said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And that you soon shall know&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Whether of us hath done any wrong,</div>
<div class="dpv01">My crab-tree staff shall show. <span class="xxpn" id="p195">{195}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin drew his gallant blade,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Made then of trusty steel&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">But the tinker he laid on so fast,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That he made Robin reel.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robins anger did arise,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He fought right manfully,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Until he had made the tinkèr</div>
<div class="dpv01">Almost then fit to fly.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With that they had a bout again,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They ply’d their weapons fast&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">The tinker threshed his bones so sore,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He made him yeeld at last.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">A boon, a boon, Robin hee cryes,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If thou wilt grant it mee.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Before I do it, the tinker said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Ile hang thee on this tree.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But the tinker looking him about,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Robin his horn did blow&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then came unto him Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And William Scadlock too.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">What is the matter, quoth Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">You sit on th’ highway side&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv00">“Here is a tinker that stands by,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That hath paid well my hide.” <span class="xxpn" id="p196">{196}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">That tinker then, said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Fain that blade I would see,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And I would try what I could do,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If hee’l do as much for me.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But Robin hee then wish’d them both</div>
<div class="dpv01">They should the quarrel cease,</div>
<div class="dpv00">“That henceforth wee may bee as one,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And ever live in peace.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And for the jovial tinkers part,</div>
<div class="dpv01">A hundred pounds Ile give</div>
<div class="dpv00">In th’ year [for] to maintain him on,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As long as he doth live.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">In manhood he is a mettled man,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And a mettle man by trade&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Never thought I that any man</div>
<div class="dpv01">Should have made mee so afraid.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And if hee will bee one of us,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Wee will take all one fare&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And whatsoever wee do get</div>
<div class="dpv01">He shall have his full share.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So the tinker was content</div>
<div class="dpv01">With them to go along,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And with them a part to take&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv01">And so I end my song.</div>

<div class="dpv01">It is but five little mile.</div>

<div class="dpv00">Then Robin he hasted over the plain,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He did neither stint nor lin,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Until he came unto the church,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Where Allin should keep his wedding.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">What hast thou here&#x202f;? the bishop then said,</div>

<div class="dpv00">I am a bold harper, quoth Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And the best in the north country.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O welcome, O welcome, the bishop he said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That musick best pleaseth me.</div>
<div class="dpv00">You shall have no musick, quoth Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Till the bride and the bridegroom I see.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With that came in a wealthy knight,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which was both grave and old,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Then Robin Hood put his horn to his mouth,</div>

<div class="dpv00">When four and twenty bowmen bold</div>
<div class="dpv01">Came leaping over the lee.</div>

<div class="dpv00">This is thy true love, Robin he said,</div>

<div class="dpv01">This ‘cloth’ does make thee a man.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When Little John went into the quire,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The people began to laugh&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">He askt them seven times in the church,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Lest three times should not be enough. <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Who gives me this maid&#x202f;? said Little John.</div>

<div class="dpv01">Full dearly he shall her buy.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And thus having ended this merry weddìng,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The bride lookt like a queen&#x202f;;</div>

ROBIN HOOD AND THE CURTALL FRYER.</span></h3>

<div class="fsz6">
<p class="pfirst">From
an old black letter copy in the collection of Anthony a
Wood; corrected by a much earlier one in the Pepysian Library,
printed by H. Gosson, about the year 1610; compared with a
later one in the same collection. The full title is: “The famous
battell betweene Robin Hood and the curtall fryer. To a New
Northerne tune.”</p>

<p>“The curtail fryer,” Dr. Stukeley says, “is a cordelier, from
the cord or rope which they wore round their wast, to whip
themselves with. They were,” adds he, “of the Franciscan order.”
Our fryer, however, is undoubtedly so called from his “curtall
dogs,” or curs, as we now say (Courtalt, F.) In fact, he is
no fryer at all, but a monk of Fountains Abbey, which was of
the Cistercian order. <span class="xxpn" id="p210">{210}</span></p>

<div class="dpv00">Go play the chiven, the stranger said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Make haste and quickly go,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Or with my fist, be sure of this,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Ile give thee buffets sto’.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Thou had’st not best buffet me, quod Robin Hood,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Yet I have those will take my part,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If I but blow my horn.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Thou wast not best wind thy horn, the stranger said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Beest thou never so much in haste,</div>
<div class="dpv00">For I can draw out a good broad sword,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And quickly cut the blast.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin Hood bent a very good bow,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To shoot, and that he would fain&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">The stranger he bent a very good bow,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To shoot at bold Robin again.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, quod Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To shoot it would be in vain&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For if we should shoot the one at the other,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The one of us may be slain.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But let’s take our swords and our broad bucklèrs,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And gang under yonder tree,</div>

<div class="dpv01">One foot I will not flee. <span class="xxpn" id="p220">{220}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin Hood lent the stranger a blow,</div>
<div class="dpv01">’Most scar’d him out of his wit&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Thou never felt blow, the stranger he said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That shall be better quit.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The stranger he drew out a good broad sword,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And hit Robin on the crown,</div>
<div class="dpv00">That from every haire of bold Robins head</div>
<div class="dpv01">The blood ran trickling down.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">God a mercy, good fellow&#x202f;! quod Robin Hood then,</div>

<div class="dpv00">The stranger then answered bold Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Ile tell thee where I do dwell&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">In Maxwell town I was bred and born,</div>

<div class="dpv00">“But ‘art thou’ a cousin of Robin Hood then&#x202f;?</div>

<div class="dpv01">I am his own sisters son. <span class="xxpn" id="p221">{221}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But, lord&#x202f;! what kissing and courting was there,</div>
<div class="dpv01">When these two cousins did greet&#x202f;!</div>
<div class="dpv00">And they went all that summers day,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And Little John did [not] meet.</div>

<div class="dpv00">But when they met with Little John,</div>

<div class="dpv00">I met with a stranger, quod Robin Hood,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Oh [no], oh no, quoth Robin Hood then,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Little John, it may [not] be so&#x202f;;</div>

<div class="dpv00">Now Robin Hood, Will Scadlock, and Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Are walking over the plain,</div>
<div class="dpv00">With a good fat buck, which Will Scadlòck</div>
<div class="dpv01">With his strong bow had slain.

<div class="dpv00">Then to yonder lodge let us take our way,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Streight from the woods came marching down</div>
<div class="dpv01">One hundred tall fellows and mo.</div>

<div class="dpv00">Stand, stand to your arms, says Will Scadlòck,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Lo&#x202f;! the enemies are within ken.</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Who, when they arriv’d, and Robin espy’d,</div>

<div class="dpv00">We thought you had in danger been,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Your horn did sound so shrill.</div>

<div class="dpv00">Nay nay, now nay, quoth Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The danger is past and gone&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">I would have you welcome my nephew here,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That has paid me two for one.</div>

<div class="dpv00">In feasting and sporting they passed the day,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Till Phœbus sunk into the deep&#x202f;;</div>

<div class="dpv00">Long had they not walked within the green-wood,</div>

<div class="dpv00">A<a class="afnanc" href="#fn300"
 id="fnanc300">300</a> beautiful damsel all alone,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That on a black palfrey did ride.

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Her riding-suit was of a sable hew black,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Cypress over her face,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Come tell me the cause, thou pretty one,</div>

<div class="dpv00">From whence thou comest, and whither thou goest,</div>
<div class="dpv01">All in this mournful plight&#x202f;?</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">From London I came, the damsel reply’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">From London upon the Thames,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Which circled is, O grief to tell&#x202f;!</div>
<div class="dpv01">Besieg’d with foreign arms,</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">By the proud prince of Arragon,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Who swears by his martial hand</div>
<div class="dpv00">To have the princess to his spouse,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Except such champions can be found,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That dare fight three to three,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Against the prince, and giants twain,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Most horrid for to see&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Whose grisly looks, and eyes like brands,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Strike terrour where they come,</div>
<div class="dpv00">With serpents hissing on their helms,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Instead of feathered plume. <span class="xxpn" id="p226">{226}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The princess shall be the victor’s prize,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now we are four damsels sent abroad,</div>

<div class="dpv00">But all in vain we have sought about,</div>

<div class="dpv00">That dare adventure life and blood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To free a lady fair.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When is the day&#x202f;? quoth Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Tell me this and no more.</div>
<div class="dpv00">On Midsummer next, the dam’sel said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which is June the twenty-four.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With that the tears trickled down her cheeks,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And silent was her tongue&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">With sighs and sobs she took her leave,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Away her palfrey sprung.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The news struck Robin to the heart,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He fell down on the grass,</div>
<div class="dpv00">His actions and his troubled mind</div>
<div class="dpv01">Shew’d he perplexed was. <span class="xxpn" id="p227">{227}</span></div>

<div class="dpv00">Where lies your grief&#x202f;? quoth Will ‘Scadlòck,’</div>
<div class="dpv01">O, master, tell to me&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">If the damsels eyes have pierc’d your heart,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I’ll fetch her back to thee.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now nay, now nay, quoth Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">She doth not cause my smart&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">But ’tis the poor distressed princèss,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That wounds me to the heart&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">I’ll go fight the [prince and] giants all,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To set the lady free.</div>
<div class="dpv00">The devil take my soul, quoth Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If I part with thy company.</div>

<div class="dpv00">Must I stay behind&#x202f;? quoth Will Scadlòck,</div>
<div class="dpv01">No, no, that must not be&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">I’le make the third man in the fight,</div>
<div class="dpv01">So we shall be three to three.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">These words cheer’d Robin to the heart,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Joy shone within his face,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Within his arms he hugg’d them both,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And kindly did imbrace.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Quoth he, We’ll put on mothley grey,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And long staves in our hands,</div>
<div class="dpv00">A scrip and bottle by our sides,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As come from the holy land. <span class="xxpn" id="p228">{228}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So may we pass along the high-way,</div>
<div class="dpv01">None will ask us from whence we came,</div>
<div class="dpv00">But take us pilgrims for to be,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Or else some holy men.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now they are on their journey gone,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As fast as they may speed,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Yet for all their haste, ere they arriv’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The princess forth was led,</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">To be deliver’d to the prince,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Who in the list did stand,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Prepar’d to fight, or else receive</div>
<div class="dpv01">His lady by the hand.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With that he walk’d about the lists,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With giants by his side&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Bring forth, said he, your champions,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Or bring me forth my bride.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">This is the four and twentieth day,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The day prefixt upon&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Bring forth my bride, or London burns,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I swear by ‘Alcaron.’&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn302" id="fnanc302">302</a> <span class="xxpn" id="p229">{229}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then cries the king, and queen likewise,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Both weeping as they ‘spake,’ <span class="xxpn" id="p230">{230}</span></div>
<div class="dpv00">Lo&#x202f;! we have brought our daughter dear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Whom we are forc’d to forsake.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With that stept out bold Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Crys, My liege, it must not be so&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Such beauty as the fair princèss</div>
<div class="dpv01">Is not for a tyrants mow.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The prince he then began to storm,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Cries, Fool, fanatick, baboon&#x202f;!&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn303" id="fnanc303">303</a></div>
<div class="dpv00">How dare thou stop my valours prize&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv01">I’ll kill thee with a frown.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Thou tyrant Turk, thou infidel,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Thus Robin began to reply,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Thy frowns I scorn&#x202f;; lo&#x202f;! here’s my gage,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And thus I thee defie.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And for those two Goliahs there,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That stand on either side,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Here are two little Davids by,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That soon can tame their pride.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then the king did for armour send,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For lances, swords, and shields&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And thus all three in armour bright,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Came marching to the field. <span class="xxpn" id="p231">{231}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The trumpets began to sound a charge,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Each singled out his man&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Their arms in pieces soon were hew’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Blood sprang from every vain.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The prince he reacht Robin Hood a blow,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He struck with might and main,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Which forc’d him to reel about the field,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As though he had been slain.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">God-a-mercy, quoth Robin, for that blow&#x202f;!</div>
<div class="dpv01">The quarrel shall soon be try’d&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">This stroke shall shew a full divorce</div>
<div class="dpv01">Betwixt thee and thy bride.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So from his shoulders he’s cut his head,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which on the ground did fall,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And grumbling sore at Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To be so dealt withal.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The giants then began to rage</div>
<div class="dpv01">To see their prince lie dead&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Thou’s be the next, quoth Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Unless thou well guard thy head.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With that his faulchion he wherl’d about,</div>
<div class="dpv01">It was both keen and sharp&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">He clave the giant to the belt,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And cut in twain his heart. <span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Will Scadlock well had play’d his part,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The giant he had brought to his knee&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Quoth Will, The devil cannot break his fast,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Unless he have you all three.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So with his faulchion he run him through,</div>
<div class="dpv01">A deep and ‘ghastly’ wound&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Who dam’d and foam’d, curst and blasphem’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And then fell to the ground.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now all the lists with shouts were fill’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The skies they did resound,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Which brought the princess to herself,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Who had fal’n in a swound.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The king and queen, and princess fair,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Came walking to the place,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And gave the champions many thanks,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And did them further grace.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Tell me, quoth the king, whence you are,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That thus disguised came,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Whose valour speaks that noble blood</div>
<div class="dpv01">Doth run through every vain.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">A boon, a boon, quoth Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">On my knees I beg and crave.</div>
<div class="dpv00">By my crown, quoth the king, I grant,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Ask what, and thou shalt have. <span class="xxpn" id="p233">{233}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then pardon I beg for my merry men,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which are in the green-wood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">For Little John and Will Scadlock,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And for me, bold Robin Hood.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Art thou Robin Hood&#x202f;? quoth the king&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">For the valour thou hast shewn,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Your pardons I do freely grant,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And welcome every one,</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The princess I promise the victor’s prize,</div>
<div class="dpv01">She cannot have you all three.</div>
<div class="dpv00">She shall chuse, quoth Robin. Said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Then little share falls to me.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then did the princess view all three,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With a comely lovely grace,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And took Will Scadlock by the hand,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Saying, Here I make my choice.</div>

ROBIN HOOD AND QUEEN KATHERINE.</span></h3>

<div class="fsz6">
<p class="pfirst">From
an old black letter copy in a private collection, compared
with another in that of Anthony a Wood. The full title is:
“Renowned Robin Hood; Or, His famous archery truly related
in the worthy exploits he acted before Queen Katherine, he being
an outlaw man; and how he obtained his own and his fellows
pardon. To a new tune.”</p>

<p>It is scarcely worth observing that there was no queen-consort
named <span class="smcap">K<b>ATHERINE</b></span> before Henry
the Fifth’s time; but as Henry the Eighth had no less than three
wives so called, the name would be sufficiently familiar to our
ballad-maker.</p>

<div class="dpv00">The priests did pray with a mournful chear,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Then Robin<a class="afnanc" href="#fn312" id="fnanc312">312</a> took pains to search them both,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Five hundred peeces presently</div>
<div class="dpv01">Upon the grass was told.</div>

<div class="dpv00">Here is a brave show, said Robin Hood,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He gave them fifty pounds a-peece,</div>

<div class="dpv01">How say you, master ‘shrieve’&#x202f;?”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now, as I live, the sheriff he said,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Some sturdy rebell is that same,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Therefore let him not go.</div>

<div class="dpv01">Some charity give unto me.” <span class="xxpn" id="p276">{276}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Why, what wouldst thou have&#x202f;? said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I pray thee tell unto me.</div>
<div class="dpv00">No lands nor livings, the beggar he said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">But a penny for charitie.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">I have no money, said Robin Hood then,</div>
<div class="dpv01">But a ranger within the wood&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">I am an outlaw, as many do know,</div>
<div class="dpv01">My name it is Robin Hood.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But yet I must tell the, bonny beggàr,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That a bout with [thee] I must try&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Thy coat of grey, lay down I say,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And my mantle of green shall lye by.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Content, content, the beggar he cry’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Thy part it will be the worse&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For I hope this bout to give thee the rout,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And then have at thy purse.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So the beggar he had a mickle long staffe,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And Robin<a class="afnanc" href="#fn319" id="fnanc319">319</a> a nut-brown sword&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">So the beggar drew nigh, and at Robin let fly,</div>
<div class="dpv01">But gave him never a word.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Fight on, fight on, said Robin Hood then,</div>
<div class="dpv01">This game well pleaseth me.</div>
<div class="dpv00">For every blow that Robin gave,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The beggar gave buffets three. <span class="xxpn" id="p277">{277}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And fighting there full hard and sore,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Not far from Nottingham town,</div>
<div class="dpv00">They never fled, till from Robin Hoods head</div>
<div class="dpv01">The blood came trickling down.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood then,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And thou and I will agree.</div>
<div class="dpv00">If that be true, the beggar he said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Thy mantle come give unto me.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now a change, a change, cri’d Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Thy bags and coat give me&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And this mantle of mine Ile to thee resign,</div>
<div class="dpv01">My horse and my braverie.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When Robin<a class="afnanc" href="#fn320" id="fnanc320">320</a> had got the beggars clothes,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He looked round about&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Methinks, said he, I seem to be</div>
<div class="dpv01">A beggar brave and stout.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">For now I have a bag for my bread,</div>
<div class="dpv01">So I have another for corn&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">I have one for salt, and another for malt,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And one for my little horn.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And now I will a begging goe,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Some charitie for to find.</div>
<div class="dpv00">And if any more of Robin you’ll know,</div>
<div class="dpv01">In ‘the’ second part ’tis behind. <span class="xxpn" id="p278">{278}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now Robin he is to Nottingham bound,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With his bag hanging down to his knee,</div>
<div class="dpv00">His staff, and his coat, scarce worth a groat,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Yet merrilie passed he.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">As Robin he passed the streets along,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He heard a pittiful cry&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Three brethren dear, as he did hear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Condemned were to dye.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin he highed to the sheriffs [house],</div>
<div class="dpv01">Some reliefe for to seek&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">He skipt, and leapt, and capered full high,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As he went along the street.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But when to the sheriffs doore he came,</div>
<div class="dpv01">There a gentleman fine and brave,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Thou beggar, said he, come tell unto me</div>
<div class="dpv01">What it is thou wouldest have.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">No meat, nor drink, said Robin Hood then,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That I come here to crave&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">But to get the lives of yeomen three,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And that I fain would have.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">That cannot be, thou bold beggàr,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Their fact it is so clear&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">I tell to thee, they hanged must be,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For stealing of our king’s deer. <span class="xxpn" id="p279">{279}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But when to the gallows they did come,</div>
<div class="dpv01">There was many a weeping eye&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">O, hold your peace, said Robin Hood then,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For certain ‘they shall’ not dye.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin he set his horn to his mouth,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And he blew out blastes three,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Till a hundred bold archers brave</div>
<div class="dpv01">Came kneeling down to his knee.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">What is your will, mastèr&#x202f;? they said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">We are at your command.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Shoot east, shoot west, said Robin Hood then,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And see you spare no man.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then they shot east, and they shot west,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Their arrows were so keen&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">The sheriffe he, and his companie,</div>
<div class="dpv01">No longer ‘could’ be seen.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then he stept to those brethren three,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And away he has them tane&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">The sheriffe was crost, and many a man lost,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That dead lay on the plain.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And away they went into the merry green wood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And sung with a merry glee&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And Robin Hood took these brethren good</div>
<div class="dpv01">To be of his yeomandrie.</div>

prize he got of the four beggers. The tune is, Robin Hood and the

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">As Robin Hood walked the forest along,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And all his yeomandree.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Sayes Robin, Some of you must a begging go,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And, Little John, it must be thee.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Sayes John, If I must a begging go,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I will have a palmer’s weed,</div>
<div class="dpv00">With a staff and a coat, and bags of all sort,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The better then I may speed.</div>

<div class="dpv01">That nothing I may leese.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now Little John he is a begging gone,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Seeking for some relief&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">But of all the beggers he met on the way,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Little John he was the chief.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But as he was walking himself alone,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Four beggers he chanced to spy,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Some deaf, and some blind, and some came behind&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">Sayes John, Heres a brave company.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Good-morrow, said John, my brethren dear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Good fortune I had you to see&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Which way do you go&#x202f;? pray let me know,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For I want some company. <span class="xxpn" id="p282">{282}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O&#x202f;! what is here to do&#x202f;? then said Little John&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv01">Why ring all these bells&#x202f;? said he&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">What dog is a hanging&#x202f;? Come, let us be ganging,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That we the truth may see.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Here is no dog a hanging, then one of them said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Good fellow, we tell unto thee&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">But here is one dead, that will give us cheese and bread,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And it may be one single penny,</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">We have brethren in London, another he said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">So have we in Coventry,</div>
<div class="dpv00">In Barwick and Dover, and all the world over,</div>
<div class="dpv01">But ne’er a crookt carril like thee.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Therefore stand thee back, thou crooked carèl,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And take that knock on the crown.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Nay, said Little John, Ile not yet be gone,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For a bout will I have of you round.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now have at you all, then said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If you be so full of your blows&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Fight on all four, and nere give ore,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Whether you be friends or foes.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">John nipped the dumb, and made him to rore,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And the blind ‘he made to’&#x202f;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn321" id="fnanc321">321</a> see&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And he that a cripple had been seven years,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He made run then faster than he. <span class="xxpn" id="p283">{283}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And flinging them all against the wall,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With many a sturdie bang,</div>
<div class="dpv00">It made John sing, to hear the gold ring,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which again the walls cryed twang.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then he got out of the beggers cloak,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Three hundred pound in gold,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Good fortune had I, then said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Such a good sight to behold.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But what found he in the beggar’s bag</div>
<div class="dpv01">But three hundred pound and three&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv00">“If I drink water while this doth last,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Then an ill death may I dye&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And my begging trade I will now give ore,</div>
<div class="dpv01">My fortune hath bin so good&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Therefore Ile not stay, but I will away,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To the forrest of merry Sherwood.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And when to the forrest of Sherwood he came,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He quickly there did see</div>
<div class="dpv00">His master good, bold Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And all his company.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">What news&#x202f;? What news&#x202f;? then said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Come, Little John, tell unto me&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">How hast thou sped with thy beggers trade&#x202f;?</div>

<div class="dpv00">No news but good, said Little John,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Before you shall shoot, the thing I’ll dispute,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">These thirteen long summers, quoth Robin, I’m sure,</div>

<div class="dpv00">Bold Robin Hood had a sword of the best,</div>

<div class="dpv00">The very first blow that the forester gave,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">At quarter-staff then they resolved to play,</div>

<div class="dpv00">At length in a rage the forester grew,</div>

<div class="dpv00">The forester ne’er was so merry before,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As then he was with these brave souls,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Who never would fail, in wine, beer, or ale,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To take off their cherishing bowls.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin Hood gave him a mantle of green,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Broad arrows, and curious long bow&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">This done, the next day, so gallant and gay,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He marched them all on a row.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Quoth he, My brave yeomen, be true to your trust,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And then we may range the woods wide.</div>
<div class="dpv00">They all did declare, and solemnly swear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They would conquer, or die by his side.</div>

ROBIN HOOD AND LITTLE JOHN:</span></h3>

<div class="fsz6">
<p>“Being an account of their first meeting, their fierce
encounter, and conquest. To which is added, their friendly
agreement; and how he came to be called Little John. Tune of Arthur
a Bland.”</p>

<p>This ballad is named in a schedule of such things under an
agreement between W. Thackeray and others in 1689 (Col. Pepys. vol.
5), but is here given as corrected from a copy in the “Collection
of Old Ballads,” 1723.</p>

<p>The notion that Little John obtained this
appellation, ironically, from his superior stature,
though doubtless ill-founded, is of considerable
antiquity. See “Notes and Illustrations to the Life,” p.
cxvi.</p></div></div><!--dwthmaintext--></div><!--chapter-->

<div class="section">
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When Robin Hood was about twenty years old,</div>
<div class="dpv03"><i>With a hey down, down, and a down</i>&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">He happen’d to meet Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv00">A jolly brisk blade, right fit for the trade,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For he was a lusty young man. <span class="xxpn" id="p291">{291}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Tho’ he was call’d Little, his limbs they were large,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And his stature was seven foot high&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Whereever he came, they quak’d at his name,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For soon he would make them to fly.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">How they came acquainted, I’ll tell you in brief,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If you would but listen awhile&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For this very jest, among all the rest,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I think it may cause you to smile.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">For Robin Hood said to his jolly bowmèn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Pray tarry you here in this grove&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And see that you all observe well my call,</div>
<div class="dpv01">While thorough the forest I rove.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">We have had no sport for these fourteen long days,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Therefore now abroad will I go&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Now should I be beat, and cannot retreat,</div>
<div class="dpv01">My horn I will presently blow.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then did he shake hands with his merry men all,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And bid them at present good b’ w’ye&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then, as near the brook his journey he took,</div>
<div class="dpv01">A stranger he chanc’d to espy.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They happen’d to meet on a long narrow bridge,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And neither of them would give way&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Quoth bold Robin Hood, and sturdily stood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I’ll shew you right Nottingham-play. <span class="xxpn" id="p292">{292}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With that from his quiver an arrow he drew,</div>
<div class="dpv01">A broad arrow with a goose-wing.</div>
<div class="dpv00">The stranger reply’d, I’ll liquor thy hide,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If thou offer to touch the string.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Quoth bold Robin Hood, Thou dost prate like an ass,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For were I to bend but my bow,</div>
<div class="dpv00">I could send a dart, quite thro’ thy proud heart,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Before thou could’st strike me one blow.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Thou talk’st like a coward, the stranger reply’d&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">Well arm’d with a long bow you stand,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To shoot at my breast, while I, I protest,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Have nought but a staff in my hand.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The name of a coward, quoth Robin, I scorn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Therefore my long bow I’ll lay by&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And now, for thy sake, a staff will I take,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The truth of thy manhood to try.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin Hood stept to a thicket of trees,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And chose him a staff of ground oak&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Now this being done, away he did run</div>
<div class="dpv01">To the stranger, and merrily spoke&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Lo&#x202f;! see my staff is lusty and tough,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Now here on the bridge we will play&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Whoever falls in, the other shall win</div>
<div class="dpv01">The battle, and so we’ll away. <span class="xxpn" id="p293">{293}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With all my whole heart, the stranger reply’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I scorn in the least to give out&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">This said, they fell to’t without more dispute,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And their staffs they did flourish about.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">At first Robin he gave the stranger a bang,</div>
<div class="dpv01">So hard that he made his bones ring&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">The stranger he said, This must be repaid,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I’ll give you as good as you bring.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So long as I am able to handle a staff,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To die in your debt, friend, I scorn.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then to it each goes, and follow’d their blows,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As if they’d been threshing of corn.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The stranger gave Robin a crack on the crown,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which caused the blood to appear&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin enrag’d, more fiercely engag’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And follow’d his blows more severe.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So thick and so fast did he lay it on him,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With a passionate fury and ire&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">At every stroke he made him to smoke,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As if he had been all on fire.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O then into fury the stranger he grew,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And gave him a damnable look,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And with it a blow that laid him full low,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And tumbl’d him into the brook. <span class="xxpn" id="p294">{294}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">I prithee, good fellow, O where art thou now&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv01">The stranger, in laughter, he cry’d.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Quoth bold Robin Hood, Good faith, in the flood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And floating along with the tide.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">I needs must acknowledge thou art a brave soul,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With thee I’ll no longer contend&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For needs must I say, thou hast got the day,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Our battel shall be at an end.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then unto the bank he did presently wade,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And pull’d himself out by a thorn&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Which done, at the last he blow’d a loud blast</div>
<div class="dpv01">Straitway on his fine bugle-horn&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The eccho of which through the vallies did fly,</div>
<div class="dpv01">At which his stout bowmen appear’d,</div>
<div class="dpv00">All cloathed in green, most gay to be seen,</div>
<div class="dpv01">So up to their master they steer’d.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O, what’s the matter&#x202f;? quoth William Stutely,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Good master, you are wet to the skin.</div>
<div class="dpv00">No matter, quoth he, the lad which you see</div>
<div class="dpv01">In fighting hath tumbl’d me in.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He shall not go scot-free, the others reply’d&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">So strait they were seizing him there,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To duck him likewise&#x202f;: but Robin Hood cries,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He is a stout fellow&#x202f;; forbear. <span class="xxpn" id="p295">{295}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">There’s no one shall wrong thee, friend, be not afraid&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">These bowmen upon me do wait&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">There’s threescore and nine&#x202f;; if thou wilt be mine,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Thou shalt have my livery strait,</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And other accoutrements fit for a man&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">Speak up, jolly blade, never fear&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">I’ll teach you also the use of the bow,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To shoot at the fat fallow deer.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O, here is my hand, the stranger reply’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I’ll serve you with all my whole heart&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">My name is John Little, a man of good mettle&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">Ne’re doubt me, for I’ll play my part.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">His name shall be alter’d, quoth William Stutely,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And I will his godfather be&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Prepare then a feast, and none of the least,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For we will be merry, quoth he.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They presently fetch’d him a brace of fat does,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With humming strong liquor likewise&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">They lov’d what was good&#x202f;; so, in the green wood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">This pretty sweet babe they baptize.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He was, I must tell you, but seven foot high,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And, may be, an ell in the waste&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">A sweet pretty lad&#x202f;: much feasting they had&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">Bold Robin the christ’ning grac’d, <span class="xxpn" id="p296">{296}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With all his bowmen, which stood in a ring,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And were of the Nottingham breed&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Brave Stutely came then, with seven yeomèn,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And did in this manner proceed&#x202f;:</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">This infant was called John Little, quoth he&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which name shall be changed anon&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">The words we’ll transpose&#x202f;; so whereever he goes,</div>
<div class="dpv01">His name shall be call’d Little John.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They all with a shout made the elements ring&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">So soon as the office was ore,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To feasting they went, with true merriment,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And tippl’d strong liquor gillore.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin he took the pretty sweet babe,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And cloath’d him from top to the toe,</div>
<div class="dpv00">In garments of green, most gay to be seen,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And gave him a curious long bow.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“Thou shalt be an archer, as well as the best,</div>

<div class="dpv01">While bishops have ought in their purse.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">We live here like ‘squires, or lords of renown,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then musick and dancing did finish the day&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">At length, when the sun waxed low,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Then all the whole train the grove did refrain,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And unto their caves they did go.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And so, ever after, as long as he liv’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Altho’ he was proper and tall,</div>

ROBIN HOOD AND THE BISHOP OF HEREFORD.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst fsz6">This excellent ballad, given from the common
edition of Aldermary-church-yard (compared with the York copy),
is supposed to be modern; the story, however, seems alluded to
in the ballad of “Renowned Robin Hood.” The full title is “The
Bishop of Hereford’s entertainment by Robin Hood and Little John,
&amp;c. in merry Barnsdale.” The tune is added from an engraved
sheet.</p></div><!--dwthmaintext--></div><!--chapter-->

<div class="dpv00">As it befel, in merry Barnsdale,</div>
<div class="dpv01">‘All’ under the green-wood-tree,</div>
<div class="dpv00">The bishop of Hereford was to come by,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With all his company.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Come, kill [me] a ven’son, said bold Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Come, kill me a good fat deer,</div>
<div class="dpv00">The bishop of Hereford is to dine with me to-day,</div>

<div class="dpv00">We’ll kill a fat ven’son, said bold Robin Hood,</div>

<div class="dpv00">And we will watch the bishop narrowly,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Lest some other way he should ride.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Robin Hood dress’d himself in shepherd’s attire,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With six of his men also&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And, when the bishop of Hereford came by,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They about the fire did go.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O what is the matter&#x202f;? then said the bishòp,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Or for whom do you make this a-do&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv00">Or why do you kill the king’s ven’son,</div>
<div class="dpv01">When your company is so few&#x202f;?</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">We are shephèrds, said bold Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And we keep sheep all the year,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And we are disposed to be merry this day,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And to kill of the king’s fat deer. <span class="xxpn" id="p300">{300}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">You are brave fellows&#x202f;! said the bishòp,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And the king of your doings shall know&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Therefore make haste, and come along with me,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For before the king you shall go.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O pardon, O pardon, said bold Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">O pardon, I thee pray&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For it becomes not your lordships coat</div>
<div class="dpv01">To take so many lives away.</div>

<div class="dpv00">No pardon, no pardon, said the bishòp,</div>
<div class="dpv01">No pardon I thee owe&#x202f;;</div>

<div class="dpv01">For before the king you shall go.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin set his back against a tree,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And his foot against a thorn,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And from underneath his shepherds coat</div>
<div class="dpv01">He pull’d out a bugle-horn.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He put the little end to his mouth,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And a loud blast did he blow,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Till threescore and ten of bold Robin’s men</div>
<div class="dpv01">Came running all on a row&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">All making obeysance to bold Robin Hood&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">’Twas a comely sight for to see.</div>
<div class="dpv00">What is the matter, master, said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That you blow so hastily&#x202f;? <span class="xxpn" id="p301">{301}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“O here is the bishop of Herefòrd,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And no pardon we shall have.”</div>
<div class="dpv00">Cut off his head, master, said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And throw him into his grave.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O pardon, O pardon, said the bishòp,</div>
<div class="dpv01">O pardon I thee pray&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For if I had known it had been you,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I’d have gone some other way.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">No pardon, no pardon, said bold Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">No pardon I thee owe&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Therefore make haste, and come along with me,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For to merry Barnsdale you shall go.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin he took the bishop by the hand,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And led him to merry Barnsdale&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">He made him to stay and sup with him that night,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And to drink wine, beer, and ale.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Call in a reckoning, said the bishòp,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For methinks it grows wond’rous high.</div>
<div class="dpv00">Lend me your purse, master, said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And I’ll tell you bye and bye.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Little John took the bishop’s cloak,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And spread it upon the ground,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And out of the bishop’s portmantua</div>
<div class="dpv01">He told three hundred pound. <span class="xxpn" id="p302">{302}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Here’s money enough, master, said Little John,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Robin Hood took the bishop by the hand,</div>

ROBIN HOOD RESCUING THE WIDOW’S THREE
SONS FROM THE SHERIFF WHEN
GOING TO BE EXECUTED.</span></h3>

<div class="fsz6">
<p class="pfirst">This ballad, from the York edition of “Robin Hood’s Garland,”
is probably one of the oldest extant of which he is the subject.
In the more common editions is a modernised copy, in which the
“silly old woman” is converted into “a gay lady;” but even this
is more ancient than many of the pieces here inserted, and is
entitled, by its merit, to a place in the Appendix.</p>

<p>The circumstance of Robin’s changing clothes with the
palmer is, possibly, taken from an old romance intitled “The
noble hystory of the moost excellent and myghty prynce and
hygh renowmed knyght kynge Ponthus of Galyce and of lytell
Brytayne, Enprynted at London in Flete strete at the sygne of
the sonne by Wynkyn de Worde, In the yere of our lorde god,
<span class="smmaj">M.CCCCC.XI.</span>,” 4to, b. l., sig. I. 6:
“And as he [Ponthus] rode he met with a poore palmer beggynge
his brede the whiche had his gowne all to clouted and an olde
pylled hatte, so he alyght and sayd to the palmer, frende we
shall make a chaunge of all our garmentes, for <span class="xxpn"
id="p304">{304}</span> ye shall have my gowne and I shall have
yours and your hatte. A syr sayd the palmer ye bourde you with
me. In good fayth sayd Ponthus I do not, so he dyspoyled hym and
cladde hym with all his rayment, and he put vpon hym the poore
mannes gowne, his gyrdell, his hosyn, his shone, his hatte, and his
bourden.”</p></div></div><!--dwthmaintext--></div><!--chapter-->

<div class="dpv00">Perplexed and vexed, and troubled in mind,</div>

<div class="dpv00">With quiver and bow, sword, buckler, and all,</div>

<div class="dpv00">But Robin Hood, hee himself had disguis’d,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They drew out their swords, and to cutting they went,</div>
<div class="dpv01">At least an hour or more,</div>

<div class="dpv00">When Marian did hear the voice of her love,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">A stately banquet ‘they’ had full soon,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Great flaggons of wine were set on the board,</div>

<div class="dpv01">Whilst their knees did touch the ground.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">First Robin Hood began a health</div>

<div class="dpv00">For in a brave venie they tost off the bouls,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">At last they ended their merryment,</div>

<div class="dpv00">I never hurt the ‘husbandmen’</div>
<div class="dpv01">That use to till the ground&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Nor spill their blood who range the wood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To follow hawk or hound.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">My chiefest spite to clergy is,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Who in these days bear great sway&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">With fryars and monks, with their fine sprunks,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I make my chiefest prey.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But I am very glad, says Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That I have met you here&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Come, before we end, you shall, my friend,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Taste of our green-wood cheer. <span class="xxpn" id="p317">{317}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The king he then did marvel much,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And so did all his men&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">They thought with fear, what kind of cheer,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Robin would provide for them.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Robin took the kings horse by the head,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And led him to his tent&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Thou wouldst not be so us’d, quoth he,</div>
<div class="dpv01">But that my king thee sent.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Nay, more than that, quoth Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For good king Richards sake,</div>
<div class="dpv00">If you had as much gold as ever I told,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I would not one penny take.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin set his horn to his mouth,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And a loud blast he did blow,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Till a hundred and ten of Robin Hoods men,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Came marching all of a row.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And when they came bold Robin before,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Each man did bend his knee&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">O, thought the king, ’tis a gallant thing,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And a seemly sight to see.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Within himself the king did say,</div>
<div class="dpv01">These men of Robin Hoods</div>
<div class="dpv00">More humble be than mine to me&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">So the court may learn of the woods. <span class="xxpn" id="p318">{318}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So then they all to dinner went,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Upon a carpet green&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Black, yellow, red, finely minglèd,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Most curious to be seen.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Venison and fowls were plenty there,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With fish out of the river&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">King Richard swore, on sea or shore,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He never was feasted better.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin takes a cann of ale&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv01">“Come, let us now begin&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And every man shall have his cann&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv01">Here’s a health unto the king.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The king himself drank to the king,</div>
<div class="dpv01">So round about it went&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Two barrels of ale, both stout and stale,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To pledge that health was spent.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And, after that, a bowl of wine</div>
<div class="dpv01">In his hand took Robin Hood&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Until I die, I’ll drink wine, said he,</div>
<div class="dpv01">While I live in the green wood.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Bend all your bows, said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And with the grey-goose-wing,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Such sport now show, as you would do</div>
<div class="dpv01">In the presence of the king. <span class="xxpn" id="p319">{319}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They shewed such brave archery,</div>
<div class="dpv01">By cleaving sticks and wands,</div>
<div class="dpv00">That the king did say, such men as they</div>
<div class="dpv01">Live not in many lands.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Well, Robin Hood, then says the king,</div>
<div class="dpv01">If I could thy pardon get,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To serve the king in every thing</div>
<div class="dpv01">Would’st thou thy mind firm set&#x202f;?</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Yes, ‘with all’ my heart, bold Robin said,</div>
<div class="dpv01">So they flung off their hoods&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">To serve the king in every thing,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They swore they would spend their ‘bloods.’</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">For a clergyman was first my bane,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which makes me hate them all,</div>
<div class="dpv00">But if you will be so kind to me,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Love them again I shall.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The king no longer could forbear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For he was mov’d with ‘ruth.’</div>
<div class="dpvctr"><hr class="hrpv0" /></div>
<div class="dpvctr"><hr class="hrpv1" /></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“I am the king, ‘your’ sovereign king,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That appears before you all.”</div>
<div class="dpv00">When Robin saw that it was he,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Strait then he down did fall. <span class="xxpn" id="p320">{320}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Stand up again, then said the king,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I’ll thee thy pardon give&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Stand up, my friend, who can contend,</div>
<div class="dpv01">When I give leave to live&#x202f;?</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So they are all gone to Nottingham,</div>
<div class="dpv01">All shouting as they came&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">But when the people them did see,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They thought the king was slain&#x202f;;</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">And for that cause the outlaws were come,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To rule all as they list&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And for to shun, which ‘way’ to run,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The people did not wist.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The plowman left the plow in the fields,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The smith ran from his shop&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Old folks also, that scarce could go,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Over their sticks did hop.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The king soon did let them understand</div>
<div class="dpv01">He had been in the green-wood,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And from that day, for evermore,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He’d forgiven Robin Hood.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then [when] the people they did hear,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And [that] the truth was known,</div>
<div class="dpv00">They all did sing, God save the king&#x202f;!</div>
<div class="dpv01">Hang care, the town’s our own&#x202f;! <span class="xxpn" id="p321">{321}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">What’s that Robin Hood&#x202f;? then said the sheriff,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That varlet I do hate&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Both me and mine he caused to dine,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And serv’d us all with one plate.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Ho, ho, said Robin Hood, I know what you mean,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Come, take your gold again&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Be friends with me, and I with thee,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And so with every man.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Now, master sheriff, you are paid,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And since you are beginner,</div>
<div class="dpv00">As well as you give me my due,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For you ne’er paid for that dinner.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">But if ‘that it’ should please the king,</div>
<div class="dpv01">So much your house to grace,</div>
<div class="dpv00">To sup with you, for, to speak true,</div>
<div class="dpv01">[I] know you ne’er was base.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The sheriff [this] could not gainsay,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For a trick was put upon him&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">A supper was drest, the king was a guest,</div>
<div class="dpv01">But he thought ’twould have outdone him.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">They are all gone to London court,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Robin Hood with all his train&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">He once was there a noble peer,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And now he’s there again. <span class="xxpn" id="p322">{322}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Many such pranks brave Robin play’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">While he liv’d in the green wood&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Now, my friend, attend, and hear an end</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of honest Robin Hood.</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">When as the sheriff of Nottingham</div>
<div class="dpv01">Was come with mickle grief,</div>
<div class="dpv00">He talk’d no good of Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That strong and sturdy thief.</div>
<div class="dpv03"><i>Fal la dal de.</i></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So unto London road he past,</div>
<div class="dpv01">His losses to unfold</div>
<div class="dpv00">To king Richàrd, who did regard</div>
<div class="dpv01">The tale that he had told. <span class="xxpn" id="p324">{324}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Why, quoth the king, what shall I do&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv01">Art thou not sheriff for me&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv00">The law is in force, to take thy course</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of them that injure thee.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Go get thee gone, and by thyself</div>
<div class="dpv01">Devise some tricking game,</div>
<div class="dpv00">For to enthral yon rebels all,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Go take thy course with them.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So away the sheriff he return’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And by the way he thought</div>
<div class="dpv00">Of th’ words of the king, and how the thing</div>
<div class="dpv01">To pass might well be brought.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">For within his mind he imaginèd,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That when such matches were,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Those outlaws stout, without all doubt,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Would be the bowmen there.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So an arrow with a golden head,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And shaft of silver-white,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Who on the day should bear away</div>
<div class="dpv01">For his own proper right.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Tidings came to bold Robin Hood,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">With that stept forth a brave young man,</div>
<div class="dpv01">David of Doncastèr,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Master, said he, be rul’d by me,</div>
<div class="dpv01">From the green wood we’ll not stir.</div>

<div class="dpv00">To tell the truth, I’m well inform’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Yon match it is a wile&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">The sheriff, I wiss, devises this</div>
<div class="dpv01">Us archers to beguile.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Thou smells of a coward, said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Thy words do not please me&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Come on’t what will, I’ll try my skill,</div>
<div class="dpv01">At yon brave archery.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O then bespoke brave Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Come let us thither gang&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Come listen to me, how it shall be,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That we need not be ken’d.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Our mantles all of Lincoln-green</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">One shall wear white, another red,</div>
<div class="dpv01">One yellow, another blue&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Thus in disguise, ‘to’ the exercise</div>
<div class="dpv01">We’ll gang, whate’er insue. <span class="xxpn" id="p326">{326}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Forth from the green wood they are gone,</div>
<div class="dpv01">With hearts all firm and stout,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Resolving [then] with the sheriff’s men</div>
<div class="dpv01">To have a hearty bout.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So themselves they mixed with the rest,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To prevent all suspicion&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">For if they should together hold,</div>
<div class="dpv01">They thought it no discretion.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So the sheriff ‘looked’ round about,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Amongst eight hundred men,</div>
<div class="dpv00">But could not see the sight that he</div>
<div class="dpv01">Had long suspected then.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Some said, If Robin Hood was here,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And all his men to boot,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Sure none of them could pass these men,</div>
<div class="dpv01">So bravely they do shoot.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Ay, quoth the sheriff, and scratch’d his head,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I thought he would have been here&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">I thought he would, but tho’ he’s bold,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He durst not now appear.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">O that word griev’d Robin Hood to the heart,</div>
<div class="dpv01">He vexed in his blood&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Ere long, thought he, thou shalt well see</div>
<div class="dpv01">That here was Robin Hood. <span class="xxpn" id="p327">{327}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Some cried, Blue jacket&#x202f;! another cried, Brown&#x202f;!</div>
<div class="dpv01">And a third cried, Brave yellow&#x202f;!</div>
<div class="dpv00">But the fourth man said, Yon man in red</div>
<div class="dpv01">In this place has no fellow.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">For that was Robin Hood himself,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For he was cloath’d in red&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">At every shot the prize he got,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For he was both sure and dead.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So the arrow with the golden head,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And shaft of silver-white,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Brave Robin Hood won, and bore with him,</div>
<div class="dpv01">For his own proper right.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">These outlaws there, that very day,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To shun all kinds of doubt,</div>
<div class="dpv00">By three or four, no less nor more,</div>
<div class="dpv01">As they went in came out.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Until they all assembled were</div>
<div class="dpv01">Under the green-wood shade,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Where they ‘report,’ in pleasant sport,</div>
<div class="dpv01">What brave pastime they made.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Says Robin Hood, all my care is,</div>
<div class="dpv01">How that yon sheriff may</div>
<div class="dpv00">Know certainly that it was I</div>
<div class="dpv01">That bore his arrow away. <span class="xxpn" id="p328">{328}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Says Little John, My counsel good</div>
<div class="dpv01">Did take effect before,</div>
<div class="dpv00">So therefore now, if you’ll allow,</div>
<div class="dpv01">I will advise once more.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Speak on, speak on, said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Thy wit’s both quick and sound,</div>
<div class="dpvctr"><hr class="hrpv0" /></div>
<div class="dpvctr"><hr class="hrpv1" /></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">This I advise, said Little John,</div>
<div class="dpv01">That a letter shall be penn’d,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And when it is done, to Nottingham</div>
<div class="dpv01">You to the sheriff shall send.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">That is well advised, said Robin Hood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">But how must it be sent&#x202f;?</div>
<div class="dpv00">“Pugh&#x202f;! when you please, ’tis done with
 ease&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv01">Master, be you content.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">I’ll stick it on my arrow’s head,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And shoot it into the town&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">The mark must show where it must go,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Whenever it lights down.”</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The project it was well perform’d,</div>
<div class="dpv01">The sheriff that letter had,</div>
<div class="dpv00">Which when he read, he scratch’d his head,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And rav’d like one that’s mad. <span
 class="xxpn" id="p329">{329}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">So we’ll leave him chafing in ‘his’ grease,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Which will do him no good&#x202f;:</div>
<div class="dpv00">Now, my friends, attend, and hear the end</div>
<div class="dpv01">Of honest Robin Hood.</div>

<div class="dpv00">One hundred men were chosen straight,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Sir William the knight, both hardy and bold,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin Hood set his horn to his mouth,</div>

<div class="dpv01">The archers came all amain.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Sir William with care he drew up his men,</div>

</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">The archers on both sides bent their bows,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And the clouds of arrows flew&#x202f;;</div>

<div class="dpv00">Yet nevertheless their fight did last</div>
<div class="dpv01">From morning till almost noon&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Both parties were stout, and loth to give out,</div>
<div class="dpv01">This was on the last day of June.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">At length they left off&#x202f;: one party they went</div>
<div class="dpv01">To London with right good will&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">And Robin Hood he to the green-wood tree,</div>
<div class="dpv01">And there he was taken ill. <span class="xxpn" id="p334">{334}</span></div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">He sent for a monk, to let him blood,</div>
<div class="dpv01">Who took his life away&#x202f;;</div>
<div class="dpv00">Now this being done, his archers they run,</div>
<div class="dpv01">It was not a time to stay.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Some got on board, and cross’d the seas,</div>
<div class="dpv01">To Flanders, France, and Spain,</div>
<div class="dpv00">And others to Rome, for fear of their doom,</div>
<div class="dpv01">But soon return’d again.</div>

<p>This very old and curious piece is preserved solely in the
editions of “Robin Hood’s Garland” printed at York (or such
as have been taken from them), where it is made to conclude
with some foolish lines (adopted from the London copy of the
preceding ballad), in order to introduce the epitaph. It is
here given from a collation of two different copies, containing
numerous variations, a few of which are retained in the

This (from an old black letter copy in Major Pearson’s
collection) is evidently the genuine second part of the present
ballad, although constantly printed as an independent article,
under the title of “Robin Hood, Will Scadlock, and Little John:
Or, a narrative of their victories obtained against the prince
of Aragon and the two giants; and how Will Scadlock married
the princess. Tune of Robin Hood; or, Hey down, down, a down:”
Instead of which, in all former editions, are given the following
incoherent stanzas, which have all the appearance of being the
fragment of a quite different <span class="nowrap">ballad:—</span></p>

<div class="dpv01">Gude master, be not afraid.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">Then Robin turned his face to the east,</div>

Acaron. This termagant prince seems intended for a sort

from Alcoran, a book: a conversion much more ancient than
the present ballad. Thus in the old metrical romance of “The

<p>Wynken de Worde printed “A lytell treatyse of the Turkes
law called Alcaron, &amp;c.” See Herbert, 224.</p>

<p>If, however, Acaron be the true reading, we shall find an idol
of that name in the Bible, 2 Regum i. 16, ed. Vulgate.</p>

<p>It was, at the same time, a proper name in the East: as
“Accaron princeps insulæ Cypri” is mentioned by Roger de
Hoveden, 786.</p></div>

Ground near Moorfields, London, famous in old times for
the archery practised there. “In the year 1498,” says Stow,
“all the gardens which had continued time out of minde, without
Mooregate, to wit, about and beyond the lordship of Fensberry,
were destroyed. And of them was made a plaine field for archers
to shoote in.” Survay of London, 1598, p. 351. See also p. 77,
where it is observed that “about the feast of S. Bartlemew .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
the officers of the city .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were challengers of all men in the
suburbes, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. before the ‘lord’ maior, aldermen, and sheriffes,
in <span class="smcap">F<b>ENSBERY</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">FIELDE,</span> to shoote the standarde, broade arrow,
and flight, for games.” There is a tract intitled, “Ayme for
Finsburie archers, or an alphabetical table of the
names of every
marke within the same fields, with the true distances, both by
the map, and dimensuration with the line. Published for the
ease of the skilfull, and behoofe of the yoonge beginners in the
famous exercise of archerie, by J. J. and E. B. To be sold at
the signe of the Swan in Grub-street, by F. Sergeant, 1594.”
16mo. Republished by R. F. 1604; and again by James Partridge,
1628, 12mo.</p>

<p>These famous archers are mentioned by Ben Jonson (Every
Man in his Humour, act i. scene 1): “Because I dwell at Hogsden
I shall keep company with none but the archers of Finsbury.”</p>

<p>The practice of shooting here is alluded to by Cotton in his
Virgile Travestie (b. iv.), 1667:</p>

Either the bishop was a very bad reckoner, or there is some
mistake in the copy: three hundred nobles are exactly a hundred
pounds. The common editions read ninety-nine angels, which
would be no more than £49, 10s. No such coin or denomination,
however, as either angel or noble existed in Robin Hood’s
time.</p></div>

<span class="hsmall">
THE PLAYE OF ROBYN HODE</span></h3>

<div class="fsz6">
<p class="pcontinue">is printed by Copland at the end of
his edition of the “Mery Geste,” &amp;c., inserted in the
present volume. It seems to be composed, certainly with little
improvement, partly from the ballad of “Robin Hood and the
Curtall Frier” (see before, p. <a href="#p209" title="go to
page 209">209</a>), or rather, perhaps, some still older piece
on the same subject, and partly from the ancient poem of “Robin
Hood and the Potter” (see p. <a href="#p081" title="go to page
81">81</a>). The whole title runs—“Here beginnethe the playe
of Robyn Hoode, very proper to be played in Maye games.” It
has here received a few corrections from White’s edition,
1634.</p></div></div><!--dwthmaintext--></div><!--chapter-->

<h3>II.
<span class="hsmall">
A FREEMAN’S SONG,</span>
<span class="hsmall">
<span class="fsz7">FOR THREE VOICES.</span></span></h3>

<div class="fsz6">
<p>This strange and whimsical performance is taken from a very
rare and curious publication, intitled “Deuteromelia: or the
second part of musicks melodie, or melodius musicke. Of pleasant
roundelaies; K. H. mirth, or freemens songs. And such
delightfull catches. London: printed for Thomas Adams dwelling
in Paules church-yard at the signe of the white lion, 1609.”
4to. Freemen’s songs is supposed to be a corruption of Three
men’s songs, from their being generally for three voices. K. H.
is King Henry’s. See “Ancient Songs,” ed. 1829, vol. i. p.
lxxix., and vol. ii. p. 54, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the collection of old printed ballads made by Anthony a
Wood is an inaccurate copy of this ancient and singular production,
in his own handwriting: “This song,” says he, “was
esteemed an old song before the rebellion broke out in 1641.”
It thereby appears that the first line of every stanza was “to be
sung thrice.” Beside the music here given, there are three parts
of “Another way,” which it was not thought necessary
to insert. <span class="xxpn" id="p354">{354}</span></p>

<div class="fsz6">
<p>This old ballad, referred to in p.
<a href="#p158" title="go to page 158">158</a> of the present volume, is
given from a black letter copy in a private collection, compared
with and very much corrected by “An antidote against melancholy:
made up in pills, compounded of witty ballads, jovial
songs, and merry catches, 1661.” The running title of the volume
is “Pills to purge melancholy,” which was afterward borrowed
by Durfey. <span class="xxpn" id="p360">{360}</span></p>

<p>There is a different, but probably much more modern, ballad
upon this popular subject, in the same measure, intitled “Arthur
o’ Bradley,” and beginning,</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“All in the merry month of May.”</div>

<p>In Jonson’s “Bartholomew Fair,” Moon-calf addresses Justice
Overdo by this name: “O lord! do you not know him, mistress?
’tis mad Arthur of Bradley that makes the orations. Brave
master, old Arthur of Bradley, how do you do? welcome to the
fair, when shall we hear you again to handle your matters with
your back against a booth, ha? I ha’ been one o’ your little
disciples, i’ my days!”</p>

<p>In “The Honest Whore,” by Decker, 1604, Bellafront, on the
Duke’s assurance that Matthio shall make her amends and marry
her, replies, “Shall he? O brave Arthur of Bradley then!”</p>

ROBIN HOOD’S DELIGHT.</span></h3>

<p class="fsz6">Dr. Pepusch, among other very curious articles of
ancient English music, was possessed of a MS. folio (supposed to
be still extant), which at p. 15 contained a tune intitled “Robin
Hood.” See Ward’s “Lives of the Professors of Gresham College,”
1740 (an interleaved copy, corrected and augmented by the author,
in the British Museum). “Robene Hude” is likewise the name of a
dance in Wedderburn’s “Complainte of Scotland,” printed in 1549.
The following tune is preserved by Oswald in his “Caledonian Pocket
Companion.”</p>

Hartshorne (8vo, 1829), from a MS. in the library of University
College, Cambridge (F. F. 5. 48), with which it has been since

A trul of trust was a common phrase. So in the ancient

<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>For

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse00"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>How

How a potter comes to be decked with so elegant and honourable
a chaplet, does not seem easy to account for; unless for the
reason given by Chaucer, that</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">—“soche araie costnith but lite.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The poet Gower, as represented on his monument in the church
of St. Mary-Overy, hath, according to Stow, “on his head a
chaplet, like a coronet of foure roses;” and it
may be remembered
that Copland, the printer of this identical May-game, dwelled
“at the signe of the rose garlande.” We see, likewise, that
“a rose garlonde” was set up (to be shot through, it is presumed)
in the “Lytell Geste of Robyn Hode,” fytte 7, v. 177. Though
the fashion of wearing such an ornament was formerly common
in France (for which see Chaucer’s “Romaunt of the Rose,” a
close translation from the French), and at a still later period in
Germany, see “The Hystorye of Reynarde the Foxe,” a translation
from the language of that country, and Moryson’s Itinerary,
1617 (part 1, p. 25, and part 3, p. 167), no further instance has
been met with of its prevalence in this country.</p></div>

<h2 class="h2herein">GLOSSARY.</h2>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Abye</i>, [to suffer].</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Air</i>, early.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Alderbest</i>, best of all. This phrase, which occurs in Chaucer,
is corrupted in De Worde’s edition to “<i>al ther</i>” and “<i>al
theyre</i>,” which Coplande has changed to “<i>al of the</i>;” whence
it may be inferred that the expression was become already
obsolete, and consequently that the poem is of much greater
antiquity than 1520: and yet Shakespeare, above half a century
after, puts the word <i>Alderliefest</i> into the mouth of Queen
Margaret in his <i>Second Part of Henry the Sixth</i>.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Angels</i>, pieces of gold coin, value 10s.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Anker</i>, hermit, anchorite.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Ar</i>, ere.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Asay</i>, <i>Asayed</i>, essayed, tried, proved.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>A-sound</i>, in a swoon.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Aunsetters</i>, ancestors.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Avow</i>, <i>Avowe</i>, protestation, confession. “<i>I make myn avow to
God</i>,” profess to God: from <i>aveu</i>, F.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Avowe</i>, maintain, <i>verbum juris</i>.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Avowè</i>, founder, patron, protector. See Spelman’s <i>Glossary</i>, <i>v.</i>
<span class="smcap">A<b>DVOCATUS</b>.</span></p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Awayte</i>, <i>Awatye me scathe</i>, lie in wait to do me harm.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Awayted</i>, lay in wait for.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Awet</i>, wit, know.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Awkwarde</i>, backward. <i>An awkwarde stroke</i> seems to mean an
unusual or out of the way stroke, one which the receiver could
not foresee, be aware of, or guard against; a sort of left or
back hand stroke. “<i>An</i> auke <i>stroke</i>” is a frequent expression
in <i>La Mort d’Arthur</i>.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Ayenst</i>, against.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Baist</i>, <i>Baste</i>, basted, belaboured.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Baith</i>, both.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bale</i>, mischief, woe, sorrow, misery.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Ballup</i>,
  p. <a href="#p306" title="go to page 306">306</a>.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Banis</i>, bane, destruction.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bear</i>, moan, lamentation, outcry.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bearing</i>, arrow.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bedene</i>, behind, one after another? <span class="xxpn" id="p388">{388}</span></p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bedyng</i>, asking. <i>Your bedyng shall be doyn</i>, your invitation
shall be complied with.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Beforen</i>, before.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Begeck</i>, <i>Give them a begeck</i>, play them a trick, make fools of
them.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Behote</i>, promised.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Benbow</i>, [a bent bow?].</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bent</i>, ii. 84.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bescro</i>, beshrew.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bestad</i>, <i>Ferre and friend bestad</i>, far
from home and without a friend. The passage, however, seems
corrupt. Perhaps, indeed, it should be <i>fren</i> (<i>frend</i> or <i>fremd</i>)
<i>bestad</i>, <i>i.e.</i> beset or surrounded by strangers.

Saxon.) Thus, in Spenser’s 4th eclogue:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft fsz7"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpv00">“So now his friend is changed for a <i>fren</i>.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pindent fsz7">Again, in Florio’s <i>Worlde of Wordes</i>, 1598: “<i>Alieno</i>, an
alien, a stranger, a forraine, a <i>freme</i>.”</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bestead</i>, beset, put to it.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Beth</i>, are, be.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Blate</i>, sheepish or foolish, as we should now say.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Blive</i>, belive, immediately.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bloschems</i>, blossoms.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bocking</i>, pouring, flowing.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bode</i>, bidden, invited.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bolt</i>, <i>Bolte</i>, <i>Boltes</i>, <i>Boltys</i>. A bolt was an arrow of a
particular kind, used chiefly for shooting at birds; having a
round or blunt head. Much’s object, it has been observed, was
not to wound, but stun, the monk, and the bolt from its shape
was peculiarly adapted to this purpose. In other passages,
however, it seems to mean either an arrow in general, or
one used for shooting at a mark. “I’ll make a shaft or a
bolt on’t,” which Shakespeare has put into the mouth of M.
Slender, appears, from Ray’s <i>Collection</i>, to have been a
common proverb.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Boote</i>, help.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Booting</i>,

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Boskyd</i>, busked, prepared, got ready.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bottle</i>, a small vessel, of wood or leather, in the shape of a cask,
in which shepherds and others employed abroad in the fields
carry or keep their drink.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bottys</i>, buts.</p>

<p class="phanga fsz7"><i>Bou</i>, bow.</p>

<div class="dtransnote">TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p class="pfirst">Original spelling and grammar have been generally
retained, with some exceptions noted below. Original printed page
numbers are shown like this: {52}. Footnotes have been relabeled
1–359, and moved from within paragraphs to the ends of chapters.
The transcriber produced the cover image and hereby assigns it
to the public domain. Original page images are available from
archive.org—search for "odcollectrobinho00ritsrich".</p>

<p>This ebook transcription includes five midi format audio files,
which permit listening to a representation of the music printed
in the original book. A midi file is not a recording of audio. It
is instead a set of instructions that are interpreted by your own
software, so that what you hear may be different from what the
transcriber heard. Sadly, many e-reading devices that use the epub
or mobi e-book format don't support links to external files, which
means that readers using such devices won't be able to conveniently
hear or download the mobi files. In that case, the html edition
of the ebook must be consulted. Also, some html browsers don't
automatically play MIDI files when the link is clicked. The user
may have to adjust some browser settings, or install a plugin, or
if the click downloads the file, then just go find the downloaded
file and open it.</p>

The Pedigree of Robin Hood in the
printed book was a complicated chart, retained as an image
in this edition. To aid the reader, a transcription of the chart
has been provided, based on the geneological numbering system
of Robert B. Henry—see for example wikipedia.org, search for
“genealogical numbering systems Henry”. I apologize for
any errors you might find in this transcription. The Henry system
starts with a progenitor, numbered 1, his/her children, numbered
11, 12, etc, followed by grandchildren 111, 112, etc. The system
ordinarily depends on knowing the order of birth of children to
parents, but that is not provided in our book, so our Henry numbers
are, in that respect, arbitrary, showing only parentage. Also, the
abbreviation m. is used in this transcription, ordinarily meaning
“married”, but in this case indicating only parentage.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
